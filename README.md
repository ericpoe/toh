The following is a draft of my novel, Theatre of Hades. Under the six word novel tradition,
(starting with Ernest Hemingway) the six word version would be this: Hades is the revolt of reality.

_Now About the story_

The concept behind the Theatre of Hades is that as a concept of "reality" gets solidified, it soon becomes under 
the control of a human hierarchy that guards this "reality" because it keeps them in control. This may be a codified
system of government (that keeps a political elite in control), a system of scientific principles (that keeps a 
scientific elite in control), an internet standard (that keeps a technological committee in control), etc. etc. 

However, life is such that every system so refined will collapse under a mess of it's own contraditions, and thus "die". 
A new reality will eventually be reborn from the ashes.

_Now Really About the Story_

This is a novel, as it were, a story of real people. It follows a protagonist, Dr. Creed, as repeatedly the very 
nature of reality breaks down, both in his own life and those of others. The stories of other breakdowns are revealed
to him in films in the mysterious Theatre of Hades, the theatre of the land of the dead. Which chronicals the struggles
of new realities waiting to be born, and the crushing structures that attempt to wipe them out. 

_Now Really, Really About the Story_

Theatre of Hades hopes to be the zaniest, bizarre, thought provoking story it can be, while still staying a story.
It's an ambitious project. I welcome any criticism, provided that is detailed and based on the current version of
my work. I might even take on a flame war, if I find the exercise useful. 

Most of all have fun. Your are entering the Land of the Dead. Nothing escapes the Land of the Dead.
