### Road Trip in Red

Dr. Creed had spent the last few nights alone in his office. He thought he'd been anxious to see people after leaving the hospital, possibly to get out and about. But instead he found it more pleasing to put his office in order. He put his spring semester lesson in order, started to track down the citations and journal entries of his old research. This had done him a world of good against his conscious expectations.

Sometime on a Thursday evening two weeks before class, his reorganized home was disrupted by an unknown caller.

“Is this Jonathon Creed?” the man asked brisquely.

“You stay in the hospital with that injured trucker, yes?”

“How did you know?”

“He wouldn't talk to the press. So I thought maybe he said a few things to his roommate.”

“Such as?”

“The location of the wreck.”

“You can't find it?”

“I followed the police reports. There's no sign of wreckage at the location they gave.”

“Everything is completely cleared?”

“Well, I'm sure they haven't removed all traces of the accident. But how to find it, without any obvious marking?”

“A liquid nitrogen truck didn't leave a physical sign on the highway?”

“I checked. Three times.”

“The guy mentioned seeing a billboard for a museum of some sort. A munitions factory for the civil war.”

“That doesn't make any sense. What would one of those be doing in Minnesota?”

“Any museums you noticed along the highway?”

“A print maker's museum, now that you mention it. Uh look, I'm going to check out the billboard. Would you like to come with?”

“I haven't met you.”

“You don't have to come if you don't want to. You may have plans I understand, and time is of the essence for me. I'm at a Starbucks about ten minutes from your house. I'll be leaving soon. I just want an extra set of eyes on the project.”

“Why?”

“Have you found nothing odd in this incident?”

“Well I uh...”

“I need a second opinion.”

“I have a little time to spare. You at the Starbucks eight miles east, near highway 52?”

“That's the one.”

“Ok then, I have a few things to clear up.”

Dr. Creed barrelled through the roads to the coffee shop. Perhaps incident number five would be a definitive break. Amongst the documents he wasn't supposed to have, the HADES card left in his office, the illness from an ancient past, and a trucker he had never talked to... there was a lot of explanations to go around.

The doctor left his house without as much as a glare in the mirror, his thoughts trying to outrace his vehicle. A screeching blare brought him back to attention after he'd run a red light. Much as he wasn't sure about this new stranger, they'd be taking his car. Two near collision and another new screw up in eght minutes had left him the impression that he might have been driving drunk. In any case, he didn't feel completely in the world.

Walking into the coffee shop he felt he knew exactly the man to talk to. The man sat in a collared shirt tapping away at a laptop Of Mediterrean extraction of some sort, he he imagined him an Arab. He maintained a well trimmed beard that suggested the explsion of beard he could have grown.

As Dr. Creed approached him he fiddled over a smart phone and almost spilled a latte when he noticed how quickly he was being approached.

“Jonathon Creed?” he asked.

“Yes.”

“You recognized me?”

“I guessed.”

“Ali Johnson. What gave me away? I pride myself on my purely Midwestern accent.”

“If you weren't unusual in some way I'd have been surprised. The way things are. May I sit?”

“Yes of course. The way things are?” Ali asked.

“Oh enough with the facade. You know what I'm talking about.”

“The Emergence,” Ali responded, though Dr. Creed wasn't quite sure what he was talking about. He just figured Ali knew somehow.

“Yes, the Emergence. What do you know about it?”

“Not much really. It's tightly under wraps. There's only a little I do know. But as a journalist I'm dead certain I'm on to something. To many little details don't make sense. Like the discrepancy between police reports and hospital records regarding the truck driver on that accident on the highway. Along with the discrepancy of records regarding your own stay in the hospital.”

“My stay?”

“In one record you have inflamation of the lungs and associated fever. In another you have a highly infectious strain of some “typhus -like” fever and are placed under isolation.”

“How could that... wait how did you find those records? Aren't they confidential?”

“The hospital sewer's been compromised. A tip off from some hacker friends.”

“Sewer's been compromised?”

“Oh, sorry, computer lingo. Sewer, the computer architecture behind the computer network, the plumbing, where information is...”

“I get it. Why the hospital.”

“They called it a 'depository'. Didn't know what that meant. Didn't know what an 'emergence' was either. But they've been decent sources before.”

“Sources for what?”

“Wouldn't tell you. Yours just isn't the first mysterious illness I've come across. You want to go to the billboard?”

“Certainly.”

Ali dropped a tip and the pair went out to Ali's Toyota and they took off.

“You a general journalist, or do you specialize in medicine?”

“I don't specialize in anything,” Ali proclaimed proudly.

“Why not?”

“What do you do by trade?”

“I'm a Greek professor.”

“History, language or both?”

“Both.”

“And if you had unlimited funds, how would you teach your students?”

“I'd take them to Greece.”

“But you can't do that now can you?”

“I haven't been able to in a while.”

“Because a specialist becomes a cog in the machine. Useful, yes. Able to pursue their interest, yes. But able to alter the course of their life... no.”

“It's been six years since I've been to Greece.” Dr. Creed sighed. “And my papers get rejected again and again.”

“Why is that?”

“Lack of evidence.”

“That's turned down many an intriguing story. But I've a method that often gets that done.”

“What's that?”

“Break the rules of evidence gathering.”

“It might work in journalism. You can keep sources anonymous. Everything has to be laid out in a scholarly journal.”

“So then publish outside academia.”

“Hmm... wait a minute. The sign, the print museum.” Dr. Creed pointed and Ali pulled the car over.

“You see signs of damage any where?” Ali asked.

“No,” Dr. Creed, walking toward the sign, answered.

“Maybe a dead end. We could try the print factory huh?”

The was no response.

“Hey Jonny, the print making factory?”

Dr. Creed walked up to the sign and saw a dark red puddle. It trailed inexorably towards the sign.

“Ali! Check this out!” he yelled.

It was a thick red muck running up the corroded metal pole like a long open wound, as flesh ripped by a blade. It was the same color of the well water he had seen in his vision.

Ali came over and looked. “What is that?” he asked. “Paint? Blood?”

“They would have dried.”

“Dyed maple syrup?”

“From where? You think someone climbed thirty feet last night with maple syrup at the exact spot we're looking for?”

“It's a bit of a jump.”

“Dr. Creed looked up to see some slight paper falling through the breezeless air. He held out his hand to reach for it, but it simply fell straight into his hand.

Ali looked over and gasped at the content of his partner's hand. Dr. Creed looked over, surprised at his alarm. Then he looked at his hands and saw a business card that read HADES.

He looked back over to Ali and said, “You've seen one of these before, haven't you Ali?”

“No,” he answered breathlessly.”

“But you know what it is?”

“It's a ticket isn't it. It just says HADES.”

“What does that mean?”

“I've heard rumors about these things...”

“What does that mean?”

“But I never expected...”

“What does that mean!”

“It's a theatre that shows films from the land of the dead. Hades.”

“Why should it be here?”

“It felll into your hands good doctor. It's for you.”

“Why should I be given such a thing?”

“You almost died.”

“True.”

“What have you heard about this theatre?”

“I've heard some things mentioned in chat rooms. Nothing escapes the land of the dead.”

“Why would they want to show me a film?”

“I don't know. I wouldn't turn the offer down.”

“Are you serious?”

“Of course I'm serious. Don't you want to know?”

“I don't know if I want to know.”

“But would you prefer not to know?”

“Then what are you going to do?”

“Well I guess I have to find the Theatre first aren't I?”

“What about the red stuff?” Creed asked.

“Oh yeah. It's not blood or paint. Somebody may have climbed the sign to dump it but that doesn't give us a clue as to what it is. It must be synthetic. Maybe toxic.”

“And it's not frozen, even in this weather.”

“Some kind of anti-freeze mixture maybe? Some solution of engine fluids?”

“There's no smell.”

“Well, maybe we could get some coins, see how it interacts with metal?”

“No,” Creed declared with a certain recognition. “Paper, a newspaper. That newspaper you were reading at Starbucks.”

“It's in the car.”

“Get it.”

Ali nodded, and dashed back to the car. He came back with the newspaper, panting.”

“You know something I don't?” he asked.

“We'll see,” He tore off a page. As soon as the paper hit the red ooze the ink slowly dissolved, as though bleached seeped through the paper. The color of the paper itself remained unchanged.

“Son of a bitch.” Ali exclaimed.

“Some chemical in print manufacturing process?”

“Yeah, and guess where a print museum just so happens to be?”

“Excellent, well this trip was well worth it. You going to do a story on it?”

“No, not yet. Story's too hot.”

“Too hot?”

“Yeah, as in we wait until the all the interesting stuff is discovered before we put out the byline.”

“What if this stuff is dangerous?”

“It's not going anywhere.”

Dr. Creed took one look over to check this assertion. The newsprint was completely blank except for a small logo from the American Party Supply Institute. “You know what this is Ali?” he asked.

“American... Party Supply Institute... Let's drive over to the factory. You can check on the phone.”

“Can do,” Creed replied, picking up the newsprint and heading towards the car. “Is this the strangest thing you've ever seen?”

“No. But if I ever find this Theatre of HADES that will take the cake.”

“What do you think happens after you die?”

“There is no God but Allah,” Ali replied, “and Mohammed is his prophet.”

“Oh,”

“Well you sound disappointed.”

“No I'm not.”

“It's not what I believe anymore.”

“Oh. But you were raised Muslim.”

“Yes.”

“What changed your mind?”

“Have you heard of a book called the Satanic Verses?”

“Satanism?”

“I don't know. I've never read it... though I heard people died over its publication.”

“How?”

“It's not hard to imagine how. The book has a premise. The premise is that the devil was allowed to insert a single verse into the Quran that wasn't true. One blemish on the direct word of God.”

“That doesn't sound so compelling. Just one verse?”

“But it is insidious. You don't know which one. Oh there are thousands of verses and the actual probability of finding it would be quite low. But you come across something in the Quran you don't like or don't understand and think, could this be the one? And when you ask yourself that question too many time well... there goes your faith. The idea is so very simple. I didn't even have to read the book. It isn't supposed to be possible to find an untruth in the Quran you're taught. But you find it all the same.”

“That one thing you can't explain...”

“You seem to know the experience.”

“An anomaly appeared in my life really. I don't know what I would have done if it was the only one . But they keep showing up.”

“Do they? I think it's the times. This day and age.”

“We live in the age of information. How can anomaly stay secret for long?”

“Point taken.”

“What about you? Life after death?”

“I don't seem to recall an answer from you on this point. But... sure, why not?”

“Why not huh?”

“No one knows how consciousness is created. How do we know how it is ended?”

“We eat then get eaten. Such is the way of things. I'll worry about these things when I get older.”

“I see. How much further to the print factory?”

“A couple of miles, why?”

“You suppose the Theatre of HADES is there?”

“We will see. Strange...” Ali began, “we haven't encountered a single car.”

“Ominous...” Creed replied, and sat in silence for the rest of the trip.

The road and landscape were splattered by red spots which were occasionally impossible to avoid. They set the car a bit off course and made the sound of slurping mud. From time to time recent tire marks could be seen on the road, though never fresh enough to give the impression of habitation.

There were no cars in the parking lot of the printing factory. Upon entering the car door the pair had their nostrils drenched with the smell of cherry caramel, burnt newspaper and bleach.

Ali tucked his nose under his shirt and Creed did the same. They hopped over puddles of red that reflected only the slightest light, and carefully trudged up the stairs to the door appearing to be the entrance. The railing was dripping red.

Ali pulled the handle to the door only to have the door opened for him by a man bearing the red uniform of an usher.

“Tickets please,” he replied.

Creed pulled out the one he recently found and starting looking through his wallet for the second.

“You have a second one?” Ali asked.

“Two tickets will not be necessary sir. I'm told the film is to have room for two. And a film only has a single ticket, from my experience.”

“So there's another...”

“Please hurry sir. Time is of the essence.”

“Why should that be” Creed insisted.

“That which escapes the Land of the Dead rarely does so for long.”

“Alright,” Dr. Creed answered. “It's your show.”

“No,” the usher replied, “It's yours.”
