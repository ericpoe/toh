#### Ali talks to Dr. Creed

Dr. Creed saw the search for Ali being trying and difficult. Ali had never made clear if he had actually planned to go to Vegas. He also expected having to justify his conclusions and actions to a skeptical Margot, like he had his father. However, upon entering a shop for coffee and donuts, a large Muslim man approached the table at which he and Margot were sitting.

"Dr. Creed. How interesting to see you," he commented. "You've brought a lady with you?"

"How do you do?" replied Margot.

"How did you find me?" Creed asked.

"GPS tracking dot on your vehicle. I couldn't be expected to lose track of a promising source while I went gallavanting to a week's worth of blackjack in Vegas. I am impressed you had the daring to follow up on such a flimsy lead, I might have. Now, knowing when you should follow up on a flimsy lead separates the good from the best."

"Why'd you just disappear to this, this vacation?" Creed asked.

"When you deal in things you struggle to accept as real, day-in-day-out, the brain tries to gain its equilibrium back by seeking out reality. Blackjack for me is such a solace."

"How should it become so? This sounds fascinating."

"I went to a boy's boarding school in the Middle East. In between studying and class, there are the barracks, forty boys to a room. Such a situation has its own cutthroat nature, you adapt or perish."

"You cannot keep a room of forty boys from attempting to sneak things into the school that they shouldn't. But with so many eyes, there is great fear of a snitch, and so the rules are clear: betray the boys and become an outcast."

"I grew up in a small town. I appreciate the sentiment." Creed responded.

"As a man of letters you would naturally surmise my contraband was books. But they required a certain deal of guile to get. Western playing cards had a great deal of value. Gambling was a vice quite easy to conceal. The blackjack dealer, of course, had odds in his favor, so a casino on the side meant income. Turkish cigarettes in particular, and slowly that meant books. But in my heart I never gave up my childhood interest. So I gamble, when I'm in the mood."

"I see."

"No, I don't think you do. No matter how you try to work the odds, black jack is a game of chance. No single hand is ever guaranteed. But if you continue to play, at least without counting cards, the dealer slowly gets the money. Scattered random acts create an ordered solution. And when the scattered random acts of my own life go to pieces, watching that process is soothing. You understand now?"

"Yes. It is a rather elaborate way to relax. And some time and patience to elaborate to someone else."

"Yes well... I see your lady friend isn't speaking."

"I'm listening. It's quite interesting." Margot replied.

"So why go into great detail about it now? You had some strong words for me back at the Theatre of HADES."

"HADES?" Margot asked.

"Umm. Yes, a most unusual theatre. They issue tickets in the shape of business cards," Creed told her.

Margot reached down her shirt and reached for something in her bra. "Like this?" She produced the familiar business card, with the logo HADES, on it."

"I knew I made a mistake doubting you," Ali replied. He also produced a ticket from inside his coat.

"What made you change your mind?" Creed asked.

"I recovered this ticket from a hostage situation that I covered for the Arab press. The recovery involved automatic rifle fire, hand-to-hand combat, and three weeks of desert survival. I was blessed with a hardy body. When that ticket was simply given to you, I resented the ease in which you got it.

"But then the movie we saw, Ooze from the Confetti Factory. I thought it a waste of time, but it grew on me, above all I think I was attracted to Lars."

"Lars, huh?" Creed mused.

"I'm an investigative journalist. I cover the Middle East. Out there is a story of rebels and tyrants. Lars was always interesting in selling things, convincing, persuading. That too is the story of tyrants. Naming parks and airports after themselves, writing themselves into history, holding pageants and film festivals in their honor. They have a product, themselves and their greatness. The rebels challenge that product. It's bad for sales.

"But I've come to understand that I as a journalist, am constantly selling something. So, when I let it, the film really challenged me. I'm sure if fifty different people saw it there'd be fifty different explanations, but there was one for me. That's when I realized I had to get a hold of you again. Imagine my surprise when my tracking device showed you coming to me."

"Excuse me for a moment," Margot surprised the two of them.

"Yes, my lady," Ali answered.

"You say you're a journalist? Cover tyrants and rebels?"

"Yes."

"I think I have a story you might find interesting. About a rebel and a tyrant. You can keep your sources anonymous, can't you?"

"Under pain of death. A man once tried to get me to name names. There's a scar, if you doubt it."

"No."

"I have only one request." Margot announced.

"What's that my lady?"

"Take my ticket. You seem greatly interested in watching the film. I don't. Take it off my hands, and I'll tell you my story."

"Yes, well, will you be waiting here?" Ali asked her.

"Whatever for?" Margot asked.

"The ticket I have is for a film that will be debuting shortly. You do feel safe on your own in Sin City?"

"Umm..."

"Just stay here. You should be safe in a public place," Ali reassured. 

"Then I'll wait for your return." Margot said curtly.
