### The Culinary Black Arts

- Notes
- A story about unrestrained growth
- Suddenly for no reason, it rains a black goop all over the desert of West Point, Nevada. It's considered a nuisance until an outsider eats some an reports it's delicious
- The goop is a culinary delight that brings great wealth, turning West Point into a boom town. It seems everyone wants a piece of the pie.
- Restaurants, agribusiness, the military, real estate, drugs, prostitution, the mob, higher education and science descend like a source of nature on this traditional town. (The military not in the original draft.

### New Story

I'm on a new draft where the story helps along the major plot line, in addition to working for it's own sake. In this version there will be real people. Last version was more like an essay with description. I'm planning on a journalist interviewing:

1. A traditionalist
2. A military man
3. A real estate developer.

All these characters genuinely care about their surrounding and have a point of view. The traditionalist sees the changes as inevitable but wants old town values (democracy and participation) to remain. The military man grows tired of the private contractors and politicians sucking the government coffers dry through corruption in the military. He doesn't see the military presence to be any form of protection. The real estate developer has mob contacts and understands its interest in the town without supporting it, along with not being too happy about other speculators.

### The Hidden Story

The four interviews conclude with the story of those three characters banding together to stop a plot by the US military to engage in weapons research by putting engineered microorganisms in the black goop to see where it pops up. When no illness pops up, and the truck covertly carrying their corrupted goods disappears, they suspect a plot. However, no matter how hard they try, they can't pin it on anything but a random robbery. The journalist uncovers this story, but makes a point to hide it away, for later revealing.

### The Real Estate Developer

"I'm a real estate speculator--first one to show up in West Point. The root of all evil, according to some."

"To the old timers."

"To them certainly, but I'm more like them than they reckon."

"How so?"

"I'm not giving up on this town. The construction contractors, my fellow speculators, the industry--hell from a lot I've heard the military--are all going to give up when that Black Rain doesn't come a second time.

"There'll only be three groups to hang on. The old timers, the church, and the mob."

"are they here now?"

"The mob? They always show up in a real estate bubble."

"You seem quite certain."

"Listen son, people thought I was crazy when I said the mob was infiltrating the garbage companies. Who takes your trash out now? The mob goes anywhere it thinks the law won't find it. Like when the law sees too much profit in a land bubble to care about the mob getting a cut. It's just business."

"Were you certain the Black Rain wouldn't come again when you came here?"

"No, I didn't It's a funny story, what changed my mind."

### The military / scientific officer

Amongst my stories at West Point, there is one that remains the most troublesome, not necessarily for its content but certainly for who is involved--the military. It should surprise few people that the military should show an interest in a strange and unexplained food source. An army marches on its stomach after all. But some fuss always arises from actual physical evidence. Something that makes vague worries about the government fact. So here lies the account.

It occurred to me that in the hasty constructions around West Point, for about a period of two and a half months there was only one public internet service provider in West Point. It would be expected that anyone offering covert services would take protective measures regarding access to the internet. However, should I get a record of the entire period these precautions could easily have not been enough to cover the government's tracks.

Here I provide enough detail on how I obtained the data to verity my claims in this piece as legitimate.

My researches led me to believe that the best way to hack their ISP would be to gain physical access to the machine. A great deal of security is (and should be) directed towards the internet. security on the physical machine is minimal by comparison.

My researches also led me to conclude that the one barrier safeguarding the machine was an administrative password.

The security of a password, never really changed with the advent of computers. Outsiders must not learn the password and insiders must remember the password. Computer password should change frequently , be random, and not be written down.
\
Owing to me lack of precise technical knowledge, it seemed my best hope that the administrator had violated the best practice of not writing the password down.

If it were written down, it was also likely to be quite close to the computer for easy access., and not difficult for the administer to find and refer to. Sure enough, it was there, and discovered with a determined search.

Upon gaining restricted access, I had a list of files and folders that should be sufficient information for a hacker to gain access remotely. Given tips from an anonymous hacker, I succeeded in locating a file named /etc/shadow. This is usually the location of the system's encrypted passwords written in plain text. A hacker in possession of such a file has beaten security.

I could have collected more information, but as my on-site access to the computer was limited I left quickly with the contents of that file. From there an attack on the ISP was possible. though I don't personally know the depth of the attack. Potentially every record was available: it is unreasonable to assume that for two and a half months the entire organization used encrypted connections / internet services for every single piece of communication and this turns out not to be the case.

I came across a great deal of information whilst an anonymous group of hackers helped me sift through the digital details in a story with real information. Not just a random collection of facts but enough mutually supporting evidence to develop a full story.

Any journalist, when faced with sensitive evidence, must make a determination of what is truly best to reveal. Should one release evidence or tell a story? If a story, who's story should be told?

In my case I would like to reveal the military in its own words. How did they talk to each other during the event? It seemed to me a story that should be told and that unlike other stories, it had not been adequately treated by someone else.

### The traditionalist

"Back in my day, when something affected the town, there was a meeting. No one told you what to do on your land. But when you did something that affected all the town, you brought it up in the meeting. People didn't always agree. Sometimes they event went against the agreements reached in those meetings. But everyone knew where you stood and where the town stood, and that if you went against the consensus your voice diminished."

Now West Point town halls, there was a cast of disagreeable characters that made it hard to get things done. But things that affect everybody should be talked about by everybody.

People will say you can't get things done that way in the town and that's the problem. I know we can't go back to the times before the Black Rain. But we're getting rid of the one thing that mattered.

"Noways the real estate people do real estate, the school board does education, the big city food merchants talk to the state government on distribution Nobody talks to the..."

"Stakeholders."

"Stock holders?"

"Well in business there are stock holders and stakeholders. The stakeholders are everyone that have a stake in the company's decision. Stock holders are the ones that stand to gain or lose money by a company's profits."

"Outsiders or insiders right? It's only the insiders they listen to any more. And isn't it convenient that all the old timers are outsiders, irrelevant, couldn't possibly know what's good for the new town?"

"All started with the damn mayor bamboozling us and making us follow the rules and not their spirit. A few months after the rains had come a scheme from everyone. a lot of people would have supported this or that, but no one wanted a meeting.

"So some folks went after the mayor. There was a rule made about 15 years ago, I remembered it as I voted on it. You couldn't end a meeting without a majority vote to have it ended.

"So the mayor comes with this contract. No one likes it, so after the discussion we all vote not to sign the contract and go home.

"But the contract is fake. The terms were made to look poor. Because there's a real contract, with it's share of subtle legal traps he wants to pass. He waits for everyone to leave, without voting to end the meeting. Then he signs the contract he wants to pass when no one's there.

"Now no one believes the action legitimate, but because it isn't written down you need a minimum person, and it's a legal contract enforced by the state it proved too hard to put a stop to it, even though most people wanted to.

"Our people saw you could get things done this way, everyone decided to do things thins way, and the process suffered as a result."

### Leaders

1. **The Old Timer** :
The Charming belligerent traditionalist Everyone knows he's probably against what the meetings for. Everyone's tired of leaving him to the same story about what went wrong with the town. But at the end of the day, he treats other members with respect, and that actually makes him a strong advocate.

2. **Leader two**:
The military man. Believes the military isn't a problem so much as the politicians and business executives influence over certain officers. Feels the town's much too precious resource that needs guarding, that the military is the right k e if only these outsiders would stop meddling. wants their resource to be publicly researched and fairly distributed.

3. **Leader three**:
the generally corrupted real estate speculator. There's a politically motivated killing that happens on one of his properties. As the traditionalist and army characters would probably be male, let's make the real estate character be female.

**Plot**: for a body of corrupt officials, spread throughout military, government, business, and organized crime.

"I can't believe we're going to a town meeting. We're gangsters, not the peon citizenry. Why are we here?"

"Because we're gangsters. You know George Malone."

George 'Crazy Eyes' Malone? Runs a string of kick ass brothels in Vegas?"

"You know what his day job is,.? How he gets his dough?"

"He don't make money on the brothels?:

"he runs a trash company. Behind the mob's decision to go into the disposal industry from the get go. Garbage companies get paid by the government. Political contacts. They're unionized. Union contacts. Intensive capital requirements that the money launderers love. Man's where he is today because he'll sell anything to anyone if the price is right."

"So what are we selling?"

"roads. The bases will love having a new route to smuggle coke to Vegas than 1-15.

### Fragment: Military

"You trying to tell a story about the war?"

"about West Point."

"In which the military is involved?"

"yes."

"It's hard to tell a story about a war."

"It has it's challenges."

"Too may people have an investment in how the story should look. Both sides want a negative judgment of the enemy. Or they don't care about the enemy, they just want a poor judgment of war."

"You seem to have sought this through."

"I've had some... time... for reflection on this matter. I didn't always see eye-to-eye with the brass. Someone leveled a false accusation. Trumped up evidence. I fought the charges and won, but I was detained for some time. Nothing to do but think."

"Where did this happen? Where were you stationed?"

"Afghanistan. War doesn't seem to end there."

"So you didn't like how Afghanistan was being run?"

"Sounds obvious doesn't it? Best answer me this, how do you go off to a foreign land, overthrow a government, and then institute one that's popular? It's not impossible."

"that is tricky."

"There is a tendency, I think, that when you can't win your battles, you can change your objectives. Not stupid certainly."

And you didn't like the new objectives."

"I didn't like the no objectives. When's the last time you heard a list of objectives that included a win condition?"

"You mean other than the rebels just lay down arms?"

"Yes,. The enemy will eventually realize it can't win. If we just guard our cities and patrol the territories, they'll see our superior resolve. I don't know. I wasn't selected for active duty again. The whole area had a blooming narcotics trade.

"I got the feeling, and I could never pin this on any specific commander, but that no one really took the idea of ridding a terrorist threat from Afghanistan seriously. That "victory" had changed so many times that "leaving" had not only been removed for the list of conditions on winning and been put on the list of conditions for losing."

"What do you think the army had to gain for a constant persons?"

"the military. The army is just a branch."

"Well, same question."
"no army is without its pilferers. The people who are just waiting to turn your back for petty advantage. Their dream battlefield is an unguarded treasure cove for looting, but they make best of what they can. While the regiment's taking a pounding they're most likely in the brothel.

"The are the kind of people that benefit from a war lasting forever. Every day is another piece of jewelry, another romp with the locals, a new stripe on the shoulder, another oil contact for his buddies back home, another opium shipment to take a cut, anything and everything that will benefit him at the cost of the people back home.

"I didn't care for these types and wouldn't look the other way, so I got sent here. Where the pilfering was worse. Less violent, but more rampant."

"So what happened with West Point?"

### Military, Science

"what is it?"

Our analyses could tell sir. It functions on a food source, a delicacy, but we can't tell where it came form."

"what do the locals say?"

"It rained down. Once. There doesn't seem to be anything that may have burst. Just an inexplicable drop of tasty goo."

"It doesn't spoil?"

"It doesn't appear to."

"Has this happened anywhere else since, or was it a singular event?"

"Singular as much as we can tell."

"This kind of thing doesn't happen without a reason. Find it."

"Yes sir."

"does any one have some information to add at this point? chemical analysis? Epidemiological anything?"

"No sir."

"It seems we have a no-spoiling resource food in the hands of civilians."

"It did full on their land sir."

"we really ought to clean it up as soon as possible, as much as possible. There's all manner of use for it. As a food source. As a luxury good."

"What would be the best way to clean it out?"

"No one knows how safe it is?"

"No."

"You there gentleman. Come with me." The commander pointed and the four of them entered a sound proof room.

When the door was slammed shut the commander turned around. "there's nothing that gets people toss out food than some food borne illness scare."

"Is the general suggesting we poison the food?"

"Not the general supply no. Plenty of food goes out to the restaurants in the area. A little could g a long way."

"True But we're talking about poisoning the American people here."

"I know. But our men and women in uniform have needs as well. A potentially unlimited food source, think of it.There is a element of scandal in this though. Have to keep things quiet. Hire independent contractors. Have some people inside the CDC."

"You can do that?"

"Didn't get to be general for nothing

###

"the truck was found with a gun shot tire, the drivers nowhere to be found, and the goop missing. Tire tracks lead away from the vehicle, barely visible in the sand. If the truck hadn't a GPS unit we might never have found it."

"How our CDC guy in Vegas found anything? No E. Coli outbreak? We should have expected thirty or forty cases this week. Nothing. We might see some isolated cases, but if someone's hoarding it, we might not see a case for years."

The General groaned. "Then we're in damage control. Is there someone who could have tipped them off? How many points of contact do we have?"

"there's our CDC guy, and anyone he talked out to get set up. There's our suppliers."

"They're fine. A small unmarked box goes through enough hands no one can pin it except the contractor."

"Who's the contractor?"

"Mob. some could sons-of-bitches. They don't cross the army for petty theft. If the contractors stole it, they'd be going rogue. Mob will hunt those bastard down if that's the wind of it."

"Track our CDC guy. This is robbery or scruples. It could be robbery, but the pieces don't add up. Unless there were some independent thieves. Even then, illness should have popped up. I think the CDC guy's our man. But I'm not certain. Is there anything back from the lab on this stuff.?"

"Chemistry can't seem to break it up. It only digests in a human stomach. There's only one definite finding: feces are loaded with carbon dioxide. Only finding."

"It's organic." the general grimaced. "That's it."

"can we try this slight again?"

"It will take time. E Coli has to be brought in again, CDC needs palms greased and mob needs new recruits. All under scrutiny of a possible mole. It will take some time, if it's worth doing again. For now we'll just have to purchase it like everyone else. Unless some sickness breaks out.

** How do might three unlikely heroes meet?**

The Old Timer was in the army, talks to the military reformer, real estate developer talks to them after uncovering the plot.
