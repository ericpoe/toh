## Story Begins

Scott Wayland awoke in a terrible fright to the sounds of a hideous rain he hadn't remembered since his Army days in Vietnam. He could hear it batter again the corrugated metal roof of his trailer. This was a disparaging thought--he hadn't concerned himself with waterproofing for three years on account of his living in the desert town of **West Point Nevada.** 

He jumped to his feet immediately, scrambling, almost looking to take cover under an aging oak coffee table before he regained his wits. He looked the clock on the wall and, his vision not being what it used to be, guessed it was 1:45 in the morning. He looked at the window and saw nothing but solid black. 

He went to open his door, trusting the inside of the trailer not to get too wet, only to discover the fierce splattering against the trailer roof did not appear to be rain, but black mud. He envisioned a burst in a sewage line, or perhaps an old oil pipeline from the unexplained prospecting that went had gone on before he was old enough to remember it. 

But as this, this viscuous muck continued to pelt down, it did not leave the kind of foul stench that could be expected of either of those to liquids.

"Scott, what's going on?" His wife asked, just as terrified at the sound, but not as quick to react as her husband.

"Dunno." Scott slumped. He supposed he was supposed to be frightened. But he couldn't tell what was going on and lacking any signs of sense from the scene, he just stared. What kind of precipitation was this? He wondered if he should be expecting frogs. He wasn't going to go out in weather like this, so he closed the door, and responded, "I don't know if there's anything to do until it stops." He replied. Just light a candle and I'll pour us some water." 

"L-l-light a candle?" his wife responded, "What are we going to do Scott?" 

"Sit right here until it stops. It's too thick to go out in. We're in shelter. We have food and water."

Scott's wife failed to be satisfied and checked the trailer's four scattered windows while Scott sat back in a rocking chair. "What if we get flooded? If it overtakes the trailer and we get.. get.. mucked in?"

"I doubt we will. But if the good Lord has decided this is how I'm going to meet my end, well I guess that's his perogative." 

"So then what do you think it is?"

"Dunno. It looks like swamp mud. It feels like swamp mud. He kicked his foot up only to realize there was still some stuck to his shoe and he'd tracked it into the house. He took his shoes off slowly under his wife's glaring eye. Then he sat down on the floor to examine them. "Like grits mixed with maple syrup," he responded. "But black."

"Just listen to how it's splattering!" his wife exclaimed. "When will it stop?" 

It stopped. 

"You were saying?" Scott asked. 

"What if it comes back?" 

Scott said nothing and opened the trailer door. "Not a cloud in the sky." he responded. I'm going to get my overalls."

"Scott?"

"There's a shovel in my truck. I'll need to go get it."

Scott trudged to the back of his rusting ancient Ford. Bought back in when times when a slight bit of money flowed through the town from an old uranium mine, a settlement that left military contractors with most of the funds. But given the state of the town of the time, fueled by nothing but marginal ranching, it had seemed like an awful lot. 

Scott pulled down the back hatch and swirled his arm around in the slurping mess. Black mud from the sky. Strange things hadn't happened in the town for a generation. Since a few gentleman had come from the east with promises of green sheets of paper. 

What was there to do? There'd be no snow plows closer than towns from the Sierra Nevada, and they wouldn't come cheap, if at all. The town would have to band together if anyone wanted to drive anywhere. 

Scott yanked out his shovel and began to thrust heaps of the syrup out of his truck. Maybe, in the midst of the common difficulties, the folk of West Point would come together to get the town in a state of repair. That was maybe a rosy picture, but it could, after all, happen. 

He thought back to the days before the mine, when there were just a few ranching families and there wasn't enough food for people to disagree much. Well, you really couldn't get along without disagreements of course, jealousy over the ladies and such, but you knew that, whatever the disagreement, the town had your back. And there was something about knowing that which made for a kind of family almost. People didn't turn their backs and plot if they didn't get along. You just couldn't and make it. 

Then the prospectors came. and strangers along with them. Infrastructure too... fresh water, vehicles, mobile homes instead of shacks. But so too came the sickness, and the prospectors left, with the only thing keeping the town alive being the government settle money. 

Maybe the black tar might have some use, Scott thought, grunting and throwing out another shovel load out of the back of his truck. What use, though, he could only imagine. It wasn't oil or coal--the smell was quite absent, as was any noxious vapor. Maybe it was some kind of peat. The rain clouds never quite came to this part of the country, but maybe it might be shipped elsewhere. In any case, it needed to be out of the street at some point. The trucks couldn't really bring in the town supplies anymore. It could be decided at the next town meeting. 

He hoped there might be some actual attendance this time. He went, at the same appointed time each month more out of a sense of duty and respect for the past than anything it had accomplished. In the old days, before the mine came, the small group of families ruled their little corner of the desert by consenus. At least until mineral rights were under discussion, in which cases notions of private property seemed to be invoked with little precedent. When the mine owners left, people, himself included, thought the lack of town meetings was where everything went wrong. But there hadn't been a decision to make in years, and the meetings were nothing but an excuse to get together and play cards. Now there was something to discuss.

There weren't, after all, places to really put this stuff. It could be driven out, to seem degree, by the trucks that seem to run on rust rather the gasoline. But to subject them to so much hauling, knowing they could not be replaced, was another matter entirely. It would have to be hauled out, bucket by bucket, by human hands, to some heap not far out of town, and that labor would need organizing. That of course, would require the town hall, for not many knew what cooperation was, living as they did of a government check that was out the door as quick as it came in. Was it a return to the old days? Only a meeting would say for sure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

"Here, here!" Roger Pilger, slammed a gavvel on the table of the crammed town hall office. The gavvel had been so ill used that Scott had thought it had disappeared. "I think you all know why this meeting was called, and that hopefully it will be short. We need to get the roads clear of course, and I expect that will be the next order of business after the meeting. But where to put it?"

"Well, what is it?" a townsman asked, "I think we can't come up with a plan if we don't know what it is. If it's poison we gotta get it in some big pile down in a valley, case some day rain comes to wash it down on us."

"Wash it down on us?" someone else replied, "It's so thick we can barely shovel it, or have you been sleeping all this time people have been digging?"

"Gentleman, gentleman," Scott interjected to bring a little civility back into the discussion. "Might I suggest that there's a great deal of work ahead, and that we not have a single idea on what to do? I think we at least ought to set out to get some scientists out to test things. Then we can think of a grand plan. Perhaps we should settle on clearing the roads."

"Here, here." One of Scott's old army buddies chimed in, trying to rally support around one of the town's elder leaders.

"Bobby, old fellow," Roger picked up, we all know you've got the most reliable truck. Could you head south to Carson City, pick up a few government men? The trustworthy folk, mind you?"

"From government men? From Carson City?" Bobby replied, to great laughter and gentle applause.

"Well, it's a needle in a haystack, I'm sure, but try."

"I suppose..." Bobby looked down dejectedly into his hat again to great applause.

"As to do while we figure out what this stuff is..."

"Wait!" said a man, a stranger, who by fashion preferences seemed to come from twenty years in the future. He had little sense that he had interrupted a town elder and his face and throw-away tourist cowboy hat were smeared with the brown-black of the sludge. "Do you know what this is?"

"Who, who are you?" Roger asked, bewildered.

"Just dune-buggying out in the desert, and find a town slathered in the most delicious sauce ever made." As if he had lost all manners, to the horror of all present, he licked his fingers, as child might after a barbeque. Everyone around him look, expected him to drop dead at any moment. He, however, looked contently, as if the meeting should continue. Everyone stood in silence. For the muck's appearance no one had suspected it might be food. Those outside shoveling at night seemed dimly aware of a pleasant smell, but by now no one in town could remember the scent. 

"So.." Roger began tentatively, thinking he must keep the meeting moving somehow. "It's edible, young man?"

"Edible?" The stranger began, "it's the most delicious, sumptuous, ecstatic,"

"Oh enough already," replied Scott, nervous the man was disrupting any season of order and reason in the preceedings, and irritated at the fancy language of the stranger.

He was right about the disruption. When it was a question of town work to be done, everyone was ready to pitch in, and explain their designs. But now there was a sense of private profit, if not to mention personal indulgence, and few seemed prepared to utter much of a word. 

"What has anyone to say about this, this stuff, be it a scourge or a blessing?" Scott replied after a few more moments of silence.

"Well, we ought to see what science has to say about the stuff, oughten we? Why don't we..." and here the speaker's voice quavered a little,"why don't we clear the roads, and let each man have his say about what to do with the stuff on his own land, until the verdict is in. Motion to adjourn the meeting?"

Scott was flabbergasted. Every town meeting had, for over fifteen years, required a motion to adjourn before it could be completed. An old mayor had the habit of trying to end meetings if his feelings on the matter were not in the majority, and since the instituting of that rule there had never been a problem regarding a meeting ending prematurely. Scott made the unprecedented move of making an objection.

"What, just wait and see, and let everyone be on their way? That's not what you call a meeting for!"

"Well, do you have any ideas, Scott?"

"I don't know exactly what to do know. But we're to express our opinions, to debate, to argue, to talk about the values of our forebears, and then come to something we can agree on, as a community."

"But what do we say then if no one knows anything?"

"I don't know," said Scott, "but we ought not to give up just because a discussion might get difficult. There was a time..." Scott looked down on the floor, an old pain now fresh in his memory, "when we didn't talk."

"But that was years ago," Scott's debator continued. "Before half of us were even alive."

"I don't care how long ago it was, it's still relevant. I say finish this meeting, no matter how many hours of unprofitable talk it might produce. Are you with me? Let's put it to a vote. Those with me, stand on my side of the town hall. Those against, on the other side."

Without another word, the members of the town parted, with most of the elders on the town on one side, and everyone else on the other side. Given the age of those wishing to remain in the meeting, in the months that were to come, this was the group that came to be known as the old timers. Only Jimmy Wayland, Scott's grandson, had come to that side. But the young outnumbered the old, even in the wasteland around West Point, and the majority stood to the other side, excepting one elder, the mayor. 

The meeting was adjourned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"We're lost, Hammond," Sherry informed, brushing the desert dust off the map.

"You're always lost, Sherry. But we're on a road. It will be fine."

"You call this a road? You draw me away from Seattle, where it's cool and wet, to this dust bowl? I swear if I have to brush one more grain out of my top..."

"What do you swear, Sherry?"

"I'll take the benefits out of friends with benefits."

"You'll like this place Sherry, I've told no one else."

"Other than a few, ahem, reputable, ahem, business partners I suppose? What's the deal?"

"You haven't been following the news?"

"The bourgeois news?"

"Yet, news a real estate developer needs to follow from time to time. Let me dispel you cultivated ignorance on this topic. About a week ago, what they're calling a Black Rain came."

"A blues musician?"

"A flood of some unintendified black substance. I've heard it's considered a delicacy amongst a few obscure cooks in Reno."

"A few obscure cooks in Reno, Hammond? Listen to yourself."

"The won't be obscure for long. You know of course, much against your delicate sensibilities, I follow Nevada state politics. So here's the story. A backdoor d--" Hammond jumped in his seat from a well placed pinch. "Yes, a backdoor deal. So listen to this, they find this Black Rain, and apparently it's some kind of delicacy. It's being shipped slowly to some restaurants in Reno that are having to turn people away. Someone in the state government thinks to get an exclusive contract. So he offers the mayor two contracts. One to present to the town, which it is known will get rejected, and the other that he wants. So a town meeting is called, and the town reads the contract, gets incensed, and rejects, and leaves the town meeting. But, and now here's where it gets interesting, the town meetings aren't over until a vote to end them. So the mayor just waits until everyone leaves, and signs the contract."

"This is some Wild West fantasy with you isn't it? Some official from the government swindles some poor frontier town and you're ready to make a buck on it because you have too much time on your hands."

"For an artist you seem short on imagination."

Sherry said nothing but grimaced. Then she sniffed a bit and said, "What's that smell?"

"Huh?" Hammond asked.

"Something smells good. I can't put my finger on it. It's certainly not hot leather."

Hammond slowed the car a bit, and the smell of the Black Rain wafted in. "It's the smell of money."

"What scheme is in that twisted, conniving head of yours?"

"Well, the first thing everybody with any kind of money or power is going to conclude on seeing the town is that no one is qualified to manage its own affairs. A bunch of cowboys. You like cowboys, don't you?"

"Hey, that was different."

"Why because he was from Argentina?"

"I thought you liked my sexual capriciousness. At least now that it favors you."

"Joking aside, people don't trust others that aren't like them. So it's simple. I've made a few calls, a few google searches, a few craiglist ads, and I'm building a new restaurant in the place. All locals mind you. So when the rest of the vultures come calling, I'll be the respectable businessman."

"What do you need me for? Isn't the decadent dilettante only going to get in the way of this whole narrative?"

"You'll be playing the part of my seclusive, exotic wife. Aren't many folks out here call it Friends With Benefits. They call it living in sin."

"What makes you think I'll be down for this plan?"

"The cuisine will be excellent. The degeneration of a Wild West town, that not appeal to your sensibilities? And there will be alcohol, plenty of it."

"You're pretty certain on that last point."

"It's a rural community. There'll be liquor."

"Well, this secluded exotic wife story better include a sick mother in California I can visit if I get bored."

"Certainly." 

"It's devious, I'll hand it to you. I'm in. You got a name for this place?"

"Sure do. Desert Rains Cafe." 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Another whiskey," Scott Wayland murmurred to the waitress of the Desert Rains Cafe.

"Why don't I take this one myself?" Hammond Griggs answered.

"The proprieator, at last. You've been a busy man," Scott replied.

"Yes, well, business never sleeps."

"Truer words rarely spoken."

"You've been at the bar asking for me for a week so I hear."

"Yes, first man to set up a business in West Point since the rains arrived. Local contractors, or as close to local as you could get it, this part of Nevada. Hired people in town, every scent of someone from the West going back home now that there's finally an opportunity... man of honor in a den of thieves..."

Hammond thought of escorting him out. It was clear these ramblings hadn't originated in drink, but had been there before he waited a week to see him. Perhaps it was someone that saw through his cover. Perhaps he was an ally. He let the man elaborate. 

"And a soldier, no doubt?"

"Yes..." it seemed the drunk man had his eye up to a looking glass. Blurred yet with clarity. "Vietnam. How could you tell?"

"You don't slouch."

"Make sure you're stiff as a board, those drill sergeants. You WWII?"

"Korea. Brass had us convinced we were saving the free world. Funny how that seemed to involve the boys getting in trouble and the brass staying home. Not that I have anything bad to say about the company. Best of the best. But time is catching up to them, sure as a Chinese bullet." 

"It bothers you," Hammond started, pulling up a chair, "having the military show up in West Point. Though I thought that might be a reference to the military."

"Not a whit. Grandfather always told us we were the West Point of... who cares? No one cares about the past anymore."

"Of course not. Always our minds on the future."

"The future? The future? All I think of in the future is a world I'm not in. I don't mean that in some dreary way you understand. What will be left of things when I'm gone. Where do you see this town going? You're a man of the future. What will the generals and businessmen make of this place. They trust you with such things. I'm just a no good Old Timer."

"Well, the military men, the open ones. Seem interested in the potential of a food source that can appear from nowhere."

"So they can send there boys off to the next middle of nowhere country that's a fatal threat to our freedom?"

"Oh, come, come. You've got to give the generals more credit than that. There's rebel groups to fund, treasonous generals to support."

"Good thing to know an upstanding man keeps a sense of humor."

"As for the businessmen, there are much like myself. They see opportunity. Particularly of a monetary kind. There are many more businessman here nowadays, as there are so many more opportunities."

"We had an opportunity. The town. We could have stood by each other and took our destiny in our own hands. Some older folks sensed it. They stood by me when I said we ought to work things out as a community. So things will work their way out. A liquor store here, a brothel there, hell, maybe even a Walmart."

"You might be interested to know there's a ISP interested in moving into the area."

"A what?"

"Internet Service Provider."

"The internet. We have to have that. Tell me, they got any plans for churches or schools?"

"We couldn't have civilization without those could we? School funding is still wrangling its way through state government. As for churches, I'm surprised I arrived here before a minister."

"What's that mean?"

"Well a shephard has to have a flock, hasn't he? So a cleverer shephard would find a pasture first and let the sheep come later."

"That's what the world follows, huh? Cleverer shephards. Wiser shephards I should hope, but those are rare to come by."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Oh God, Hammond, I don't know how much longer I can stay here." Sheryl moaned.

"What? You said..."

"I know what I said."

"Only yesterday that you've down some of your best work here. So long luscious speech about parched yellows over a scorched sun, a grey humor over a land of destiny emerging from a soil covered in black. Soaring..."

"Yes. I remember the sentiment Hammond. I did, as you point out, say it only yesterday. But come out of your office for once and look what's going on around you."

"Gladly, I need a break."

"See for a moment how the town is laid out."

Hammond took his shades and followed Sheryl out of his office. The still, gleaming black lake now everywhere in patches from being pillaged. 

"There's the old cafe, the makeshift one you built before anything else could be erected, that had a kitchen area made from an old school bus with the seats removed."

"Never seen such a shoddy site, but it made enough to get me a real establishment."

"There's what we might think of as old town, where the cattle ranchers and shop-keepers gathered because they couldn't think of a better place to meet, it's only inhabitants the dust mites. What came to replace it? Those trailers out there, built from government settlement money after the uranium bust, still held together by twine because there's no other way to hang the laundry."

"This place has certainly gotten to your artistic sensibilities, hasn't it."

"And look there, where there's a straight line of earth where all the Black Rain is removed, some by automated bulldozer working hand in hand with village residents with shovels hoping to build up a store of Rain for future sale? You know what they're making their way for. Well, a road, obviously, but then what next? Walmarts and gas stations and strip malls and K-marts and Walgreens and..."

"You did leave your Adderall behind didn't you? Didn't you?"

"I just needed a little to keep me at it before, before..."

"When's the last time you slept?"

"I don't remember. I... there's some Vikaden in my purse."

"No... no mixing uppers and downers, you know that." 

"There's just going to be so much..."

"Suburbinzation?"

"Excess."

"Why don't we go for a walk? I've been too busy. Let your muscles wind down."

"Right, right, that's a good idea. Tell me about business. Something boring, so I can drift off."

"I except your compliments. Besides, I really ought to save the interesting stuff until I'm out of earshot." 

"I see."

"So, to start, the money's pouring in without any sense of what to do with it. I spend more of my time turning business proposals away than I do in working with potential bidders. The only organization capable of getting any of its assets this far into the desert has been the military. Surprise they'd turn up, huh?"

"Strange, I haven't seen them, and I've done some looking."

"They've made themselves known to the towns movers and shakers."

"And they've left their starving artists out in the cold. How typical."

"They've been a bit shadowy. They don't want to pull up in war machines and give the townsfolk the wrong impression."

"Or the right one."

"They don't want that one either. But to some extent we're here by their good graces. They know how to keep a population supplied in the desert. None of the speculators know that, and time has worked it out of the townsfolk that did. If we strangely never seem to run out of things, they're certainly the reason."

"What do they want?"

"An army matches in its stomach."

"I'm starting to feel more sober already."

"Well, then let's turn around. Don't want to get lost in the desert."

"Hammond, look up."

"What Sheryl?"

"Do you see a cloud in the sky?"

"No."

"It's nearly nightfall."

"So."

"We're walking west. The North Star will be out and the flickering lights from the town will be more than enough to take us back."

"Woman of the night."

"You're damn right."

"So, we shall go out further then, in our discussion of the town?"

"You said you were holding something back."

"The mob."

"Seriously?"

"Nevada real estate bubble? Are you surprised?"

"Now that... that is something. Makes me want to break this town in."

"You mean sleep with someone?"

"A sailor should have girl for every town, and a girl a man for every ship. We're still just friends right?"

"Right. Ok, right. I will say it's easier to be friends with benefits when you're getting all the benefits. Who'd you have in mind?"

"Jimmy Wayland?"

"What? He's half you're age."

"He's legal, and I'm not that old. You wouldn't enjoy a romp with a girl that age?"

"Ughh."

"Oh, he'd worship me. What's that Sheryl? Anything I can do for you Sheryl?"

"At your funeral no one will say you didn't get in enough sex."

"Actually, there is someone who's struck my fancy. A journalist. Thought he might be here about the Rain, but it's hard to say, as he's never mentioned it. He's hard to read. He's been interested in selling my work. But I can't tell how much personal interest he has in it and how much is professional courtesy. I'm not sure what he's really up to. He's..."

"A mystery, Sheryl?"

"You know me well."

"The sun will be setting soon Sheryl. You do know how to get back right?"

"Of course."

"Because you know what will happen if we don't, right?"

"What?"

"We'll be two friends out in the desert. Two, just friends in the desert."

"Yes, just friends." 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"So... Joshua," Sheryl said nervously. "How much for the paintings?"

"Ten thousand."

"Thousand? Well, I guess this is the last time I have to sell myself to prostitution to pay a gas bill."

Joshua Sanchez laughed. "You have a flourish for language Sheryl. Do you write?"

"Not often. I can't really explain myself with words on paper."

"Being good with words is an asset. But you see things, and that is what I'm interested in. So, you moved to this town before word got out about the Black Rain. When it was still just a secret spice in single proprieator restaurants in Reno. Why did you come so quickly."

"Well it was Hammond's idea originally."

"Hammond Griggs, my..." Sheryl floundered. She thought of the word friend, but recognized it would blow her cover. But she didn't want to appear taken in matrimony. "...husband. Yes, it was his idea initially."

"So why did you come?"

She hadn't expected this line of questioning. "He thought I'd like it. Which I do, but you don't believe we're married."

Joshua didn't answer.

"Well, we're umm..." Sheryl didn't know the best thing to say, only to note a practiced interviewer in front of her. "friends with benefits. We have to be discreet."

"Then he ought to buy you a ring."

"You won't tell anyone."

"All my sources have strict confidentiality."

"Well, that's a comfort. I know you're a journalist, and you're here to pick up some dirt on someone. But I'm afraid I don't know about any military plans or mob dealings."

"Mob dealings?"

"You know, setting up casinos or brothels or that kind of thing."

"I'll have to keep an eye out for that. There's something too, I'd like you to keep an eye out for. If you happen to be inspired by any unusual vehicles, might you make it a point to put down license plate numbers."

"Hmm. Will do. There's something I'd ask of you."

"What?"

"News from the outside world."

"You have been following?"

"Bourgeois news dampens the imagination."

"Yes, well, the restaurants in Reno are doing double time. This substance, whatever it is, is so delicious people just can't stop coming back, and if you think Sin City is going to store losing tourist dollars to Reno, you've spent a little to much time at the art colony.

"Now, the authorities have had time to notice the culinary change of Western Nevada, and some tests have already been run. It's organic, to be certain, but the lab rats won't eat it voluntarily. No abnormalities detected thus far. As far as the FDA is concerned they have no reason to conclude its not safe to eat.Of course the military is interested in a strange new chemical food source, and I imagine biotech firms as well. And now apparently, the mob.

"So, Sheryl, your friend Hammond,"

"A lot of people have been confidential with him, I think it best you be discreet in your dealings with him. He owns the joint you're sitting in though. Wait long enough and you might get his audience. Might not be worth your time though, there's not a lot he says, even to me. And though I wouldn't want to distract you if you've got any grand designs, you might have a chat with Scott Wayland, one of the Old Timers. The military has been here before, you see, for uranium mining I believe, and he might prove most valuable to you."

"Thanks for the lead. Go capture West Point before the internet gets you. It's so hard to block out, just for having a phone."

"Just how badly do the internet companies want out here?"

"Want? The generals are bit tired of such primitive methods as radio transmissions."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Fragments for the story in progress, 01/16

- Joshua takes an interview with Scott about the military's first excursion into uranium mining, finds and copies the schematics before the military thinks to recover it. 

- The military plot, in this stage of the game, is merely to cause the Black Rain to come under the control of the government through a food-poisoning scheme. This is the plot the three band together to stop. The boom and bust of West Point, however it might rise and fall, remains outside the full control of the army, even as it's destiny may be up to developers at some point. 

- Sheryl looked at the greatest drawing of her tenure at West Point. A sketch of the canvas topped church that neighbored the newly opened gas and liquor store. It was embellished with the meeting of an army officer with a mobster, gathering in place the five institutions that made it to West Point first. The military, the mob, the church, gas, and the liquor store. She labeled it "the necessities." 

## New Story

I'm on a new draft where the story helps along the major plot line, in addition to working for it's own sake. In this version there will be real people. Last version was more like an essay with description. I'm planning on a journalist interviewing:

1. A traditionalist
2. A military man
3. A real estate developer.

All these characters genuinely care about their surrounding and have a point of view. The traditionalist sees the changes as inevitable but wants old town values (democracy and participation) to remain. The military man grows tired of the private contractors and politicians sucking the government coffers dry through corruption in the military. He doesn't see the military presence to be any form of protection. The real estate developer has mob contacts and understands its interest in the town without supporting it, along with not being too happy about other speculators.

### The Hidden Story

The four interviews conclude with the story of those three characters banding together to stop a plot by the US military to engage in weapons research by putting engineered microorganisms in the black goop to see where it pops up. When no illness pops up, and the truck covertly carrying their corrupted goods disappears, they suspect a plot. However, no matter how hard they try, they can't pin it on anything but a random robbery. The journalist uncovers this story, but makes a point to hide it away, for later revealing.

### The Real Estate Developer

"I'm a real estate speculator--first one to show up in West Point. The root of all evil, according to some."

"To the old timers."

"To them certainly, but I'm more like them than they reckon."

"How so?"

"I'm not giving up on this town. The construction contractors, my fellow speculators, the industry--hell from a lot I've heard the military--are all going to give up when that Black Rain doesn't come a second time.

"There'll only be three groups to hang on. The old timers, the church, and the mob."

"Are they here now?"

"The mob? They always show up in a real estate bubble."

"You seem quite certain."

"Listen son, people thought I was crazy when I said the mob was infiltrating the garbage companies. Who takes your trash out now? The mob goes anywhere it thinks the law won't find it. Like when the law sees too much profit in a land bubble to care about the mob getting a cut. It's just business."

"Were you certain the Black Rain wouldn't come again when you came here?"

"No, I didn't It's a funny story, what changed my mind."

### The military / scientific officer

Amongst my stories at West Point, there is one that remains the most troublesome, not necessarily for its content but certainly for who is involved--the military. It should surprise few people that the military should show an interest in a strange and unexplained food source. An army marches on its stomach after all. But some fuss always arises from actual physical evidence. Something that makes vague worries about the government fact. So here lies the account.

It occurred to me that in the hasty constructions around West Point, for about a period of two and a half months there was only one public internet service provider in West Point. It would be expected that anyone offering covert services would take protective measures regarding access to the internet. However, should I get a record of the entire period these precautions could easily have not been enough to cover the government's tracks.

Here I provide enough detail on how I obtained the data to verity my claims in this piece as legitimate.

My researches led me to believe that the best way to hack their ISP would be to gain physical access to the machine. A great deal of security is (and should be) directed towards the internet. Security on the physical machine is minimal by comparison.

My researches also led me to conclude that the one barrier safeguarding the machine was an administrative password.

The security of a password, never really changed with the advent of computers. Outsiders must not learn the password and insiders must remember the password. Computer password should change frequently, be random, and not be written down.

Owing to me lack of precise technical knowledge, it seemed my best hope that the administrator had violated the best practice of not writing the password down.

If it were written down, it was also likely to be quite close to the computer for easy access, and not difficult for the administrator to find and refer to. Sure enough, it was there, and discovered with a determined search.

Upon gaining restricted access, I had a list of files and folders that should be sufficient information for a hacker to gain access remotely. Given tips from an anonymous hacker, I succeeded in locating a file named /etc/shadow. This is usually the location of the system's encrypted passwords written in plain text. A hacker in possession of such a file has beaten security.

I could have collected more information, but as my on-site access to the computer was limited I left quickly with the contents of that file. From there an attack on the ISP was possible. though I don't personally know the depth of the attack. Potentially every record was available: it is unreasonable to assume that for two and a half months the entire organization used encrypted connections / internet services for every single piece of communication and this turns out not to be the case.

I came across a great deal of information whilst an anonymous group of hackers helped me sift through the digital details in a story with real information. Not just a random collection of facts but enough mutually supporting evidence to develop a full story.

Any journalist, when faced with sensitive evidence, must make a determination of what is truly best to reveal. Should one release evidence or tell a story? If a story, who's story should be told?

In my case I would like to reveal the military in its own words. How did they talk to each other during the event? It seemed to me a story that should be told and that unlike other stories, it had not been adequately treated by someone else.

### The traditionalist

"Back in my day, when something affected the town, there was a meeting. No one told you what to do on your land. But when you did something that affected all the town, you brought it up in the meeting. People didn't always agree. Sometimes they went against the agreements reached in those meetings. But everyone knew where you stood and where the town stood, and that if you went against the consensus your voice diminished."

Now West Point town halls, there was a cast of disagreeable characters that made it hard to get things done. But things that affect everybody should be talked about by everybody.

People will say you can't get things done that way in the town and that's the problem. I know we can't go back to the times before the Black Rain. But we're getting rid of the one thing that mattered.

"Nowadays the real estate people do real estate, the school board does education, the big city food merchants talk to the state government on distribution Nobody talks to the..."

"Stakeholders."

"Stockholders?"

"Well in business there are stockholders and stakeholders. The stakeholders are everyone that have a stake in the company's decision. Stockholders are the ones that stand to gain or lose money by a company's profits."

"Outsiders or insiders right? It's only the insiders they listen to any more. And isn't it convenient that all the old timers are outsiders, irrelevant, couldn't possibly know what's good for the new town?"

"All started with the damn mayor bamboozling us and making us follow the rules and not their spirit. A few months after the rains had come a scheme from everyone. A lot of people would have supported this or that, but no one wanted a meeting.

"So some folks went after the mayor. There was a rule made about 15 years ago, I remembered it as I voted on it. You couldn't end a meeting without a majority vote to have it ended.

"So the mayor comes with this contract. No one likes it, so after the discussion we all vote not to sign the contract and go home.

"But the contract is fake. The terms were made to look poor. Because there's a real contract, with it's share of subtle legal traps he wants to pass. He waits for everyone to leave, without voting to end the meeting. Then he signs the contract he wants to pass when no one's there.

"Now no one believes the action legitimate, but because it isn't written down you need a minimum person, and it's a legal contract enforced by the state it proved too hard to put a stop to it, even though most people wanted to.

"Our people saw you could get things done this way, everyone decided to do things thins way, and the process suffered as a result."

### Leaders

1. **The Old Timer** :
The Charming belligerent traditionalist Everyone knows he's probably against what the meetings for. Everyone's tired of leaving him to the same story about what went wrong with the town. But at the end of the day, he treats other members with respect, and that actually makes him a strong advocate.

2. **Leader two**:
The military man. Believes the military isn't a problem so much as the politicians and business executives influence over certain officers. Feels the town's much too precious resource that needs guarding, that the military is the right k e if only these outsiders would stop meddling. wants their resource to be publicly researched and fairly distributed.

3. **Leader three**:
the generally corrupted real estate speculator. There's a politically motivated killing that happens on one of his properties. As the traditionalist and army characters would probably be male, let's make the real estate character be female.

**Plot**: for a body of corrupt officials, spread throughout military, government, business, and organized crime.

"I can't believe we're going to a town meeting. We're gangsters, not the peon citizenry. Why are we here?"

"Because we're gangsters. You know George Malone."

George 'Crazy Eyes' Malone? Runs a string of kick ass brothels in Vegas?"

"You know what his day job is? How he gets his dough?"

"He don't make money on the brothels?:

"he runs a trash company. Behind the mob's decision to go into the disposal industry from the get go. Garbage companies get paid by the government. Political contacts. They're unionized. Union contacts. Intensive capital requirements that the money launderers love. Man's where he is today because he'll sell anything to anyone if the price is right."

"So what are we selling?"

"Roads. The bases will love having a new route to smuggle coke to Vegas than 1-15.

### Fragment: Military

"You trying to tell a story about the war?"

"About West Point."

"In which the military is involved?"

"Yes."

"It's hard to tell a story about a war."

"It has it's challenges."

"Too may people have an investment in how the story should look. Both sides want a negative judgment of the enemy. Or they don't care about the enemy, they just want a poor judgment of war."

"You seem to have sought this through."

"I've had some... time... for reflection on this matter. I didn't always see eye-to-eye with the brass. Someone leveled a false accusation. Trumped up evidence. I fought the charges and won, but I was detained for some time. Nothing to do but think."

"Where did this happen? Where were you stationed?"

"Afghanistan. War doesn't seem to end there."

"So you didn't like how Afghanistan was being run?"

"Sounds obvious doesn't it? Best answer me this, how do you go off to a foreign land, overthrow a government, and then institute one that's popular? It's not impossible."

"That is tricky."

"There is a tendency, I think, that when you can't win your battles, you can change your objectives. Not stupid certainly."

"And you didn't like the new objectives."

"I didn't like the no objectives. When's the last time you heard a list of objectives that included a win condition?"

"You mean other than the rebels just lay down arms?"

"Yes. The enemy will eventually realize it can't win. If we just guard our cities and patrol the territories, they'll see our superior resolve. I don't know. I wasn't selected for active duty again. The whole area had a blooming narcotics trade.

"I got the feeling, and I could never pin this on any specific commander, but that no one really took the idea of ridding a terrorist threat from Afghanistan seriously. That "victory" had changed so many times that "leaving" had not only been removed for the list of conditions on winning and been put on the list of conditions for losing."

"What do you think the army had to gain for a constant presence?"

"The military. The army is just a branch."

"Well, same question."

"No army is without its pilferers. The people who are just waiting to turn your back for petty advantage. Their dream battlefield is an unguarded treasure cove for looting, but they make best of what they can. While the regiment's taking a pounding they're most likely in the brothel.

"The are the kind of people that benefit from a war lasting forever. Every day is another piece of jewelry, another romp with the locals, a new stripe on the shoulder, another oil contact for his buddies back home, another opium shipment to take a cut, anything and everything that will benefit him at the cost of the people back home.

"I didn't care for these types and wouldn't look the other way, so I got sent here. Where the pilfering was worse. Less violent, but more rampant."

"So what happened with West Point?"

### Military, Science

"what is it?"

Our analyses could tell sir. It functions on a food source, a delicacy, but we can't tell where it came form."

"what do the locals say?"

"It rained down. Once. There doesn't seem to be anything that may have burst. Just an inexplicable drop of tasty goo."

"It doesn't spoil?"

"It doesn't appear to."

"Has this happened anywhere else since, or was it a singular event?"

"Singular as much as we can tell."

"This kind of thing doesn't happen without a reason. Find it."

"Yes sir."

"does any one have some information to add at this point? chemical analysis? Epidemiological anything?"

"No sir."

"It seems we have a no-spoiling resource food in the hands of civilians."

"It did full on their land sir."

"We really ought to clean it up as soon as possible, as much as possible. There's all manner of use for it. As a food source. As a luxury good."

"What would be the best way to clean it out?"

"No one knows how safe it is?"

"No."

"You there gentleman. Come with me." The commander pointed and the four of them entered a sound proof room.

When the door was slammed shut the commander turned around. "There's nothing that gets people toss out food than some food borne illness scare."

"Is the general suggesting we poison the food?"

"Not the general supply no. Plenty of food goes out to the restaurants in the area. A little could go a long way."

"True. But we're talking about poisoning the American people here."

"I know. But our men and women in uniform have needs as well. A potentially unlimited food source, think of it. There is a element of scandal in this though. Have to keep things quiet. Hire independent contractors. Have some people inside the CDC."

"You can do that?"

"Didn't get to be general for nothing."

###

"The truck was found with a gun shot tire, the drivers nowhere to be found, and the goop missing. Tire tracks lead away from the vehicle, barely visible in the sand. If the truck hadn't a GPS unit we might never have found it."

"How our CDC guy in Vegas found anything? No E. Coli outbreak? We should have expected thirty or forty cases this week."

"Nothing. We might see some isolated cases, but if someone's hoarding it, we might not see a case for years."

The General groaned. "Then we're in damage control. Is there someone who could have tipped them off? How many points of contact do we have?"

"There's our CDC guy, and anyone he talked out to get set up. There's our suppliers."

"They're fine. A small unmarked box goes through enough hands no one can pin it except the contractor."

"Who's the contractor?"

"Mob. some cold sons-of-bitches. They don't cross the army for petty theft. If the contractors stole it, they'd be going rogue. Mob will hunt those bastards down if that's the wind of it."

"Track our CDC guy. This is robbery or scruples. It could be robbery, but the pieces don't add up. Unless there were some independent thieves. Even then, illness should have popped up. I think the CDC guy's our man. But I'm not certain. Is there anything back from the lab on this stuff?"

"Chemistry can't seem to break it up. It only digests in a human stomach. There's only one definite finding: feces are loaded with carbon dioxide. Only finding."

"It's organic." the general grimaced. "That's it."

"Can we try this slight again?"

"It will take time. E Coli has to be brought in again, CDC needs palms greased and mob needs new recruits. All under scrutiny of a possible mole. It will take some time, if it's worth doing again. For now we'll just have to purchase it like everyone else. Unless some sickness breaks out."

**How do might three unlikely heroes meet?**

The Old Timer was in the army, talks to the military reformer, real estate developer talks to them after uncovering the plot.
