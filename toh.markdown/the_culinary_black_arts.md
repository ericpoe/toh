Synopsis: The desert town of West Point Nevada encounters a rain of black sludge. This sludge grants complete fulfillment of a strong desire, but a desire alone, not wholeness. The most immediately obvious effect is on the men and women who sexual desires are their largest pang. As the story progresses, we see inhuman gamblers, a blissful bible study, and an intimidating preacher all have their own desires stoked, to disastrous consequences.
-->

West Point was a bunch of tin shacks pocketed away in the desert in Nevada. New construction was unheard of, such that any family of size was bursting out of their rusty trailer. I don't really know where the first set of trailers came in the first place. It was as if it had always been there, and always would be. I sometimes referred to it as the Desert of Eden in my head.

Here, in this town, losses were permanent. Lose a girl, and she would linger in your life forever, possibly your only love. Win something and the town's remembrance of your victory would latch onto your reputation forever, burnt out only by a terrible disgrace.

Not that there were what outside society would call winners in West Point. There weren't any jobs really, and I could never get it out of the elders how money came into the town. I didn't want to risk my weekly stipend figuring out either.

I was a writer, or at least was, and West Point had never heard of such a thing. Oh, people wrote books somewhere. But not here. I had been keeping a journal since the age of eight, and the fifteenth anniversary of that date was fast approaching.

One might think there was nothing to keep down in a journal in a place like this, but, having lived here so long, I wondered what it might be like writing a journal like this anywhere else. There was, in this small patch of nowhere, seemingly no privacy. Act up in the one boardroom schoolhouse and your parents knew before you got home. Manage to get a hold of some booze or girlie mags and you'd be solicited for a year. The only person that had a chance of keeping a secret was you. Of course if you were too obvious about it, pressure mounted from rumors and feverish speculations. Best not to let in anything at all if you could get away with it.

It might have been best for me if no one discovered I was doing any writing at all, but I was too young to know to hide it. In some ways fortunate for my social life, my mother discover my first uncoded journals. They disappeared, my mother never seemed quite the same. Seeing someone's mind too close was like looking at the sun, or so I figured, and got to making sure my subsequent explorations were secret.

I developed what the few spy magazines in the town's slush pile called a cipher. It was a new form of cursive writing designed to look like atrocious handwriting if one weren't accustomed to the alternate curves and loops. I never kept the cipher but worked on letters one at a time during boring school lessons that I always seemed to keep on top of, no matter how little I tried. When I was satisfied with my cipher I began the task of writing in it. My writings have been confiscated many times by a nosy neighbor. To their irritation they have never been able to grasp on to the fact that they can't read my writing on purpose.

It had gotten out by this time in my life I was some sort of writer, and the fact that all my work was secret was not a fact well received. Everyone had secrets in this town, but no one, in my memory, had done something in the open that suggested they were hiding something. That I think was the kicker, they resented my open secrets in an attempt to hide their own. In any case, I was shunned, at least by day. People would come to me at night sometimes, seeking some advice, clue, or solace. It was always in secrecy and always with the expectation that I keep all activity therein a secret.

The secrets were never particularly consequential. A crush, an irritation, an idea, not much else. At least it happened this way before the Black Rain came. It was a middle of the night affair, a splattering against the tin roofs like asphalt, mud, and water curled into one and taking properties from each. I stayed inside my trailer. I expect everyone did, as it was hard to imagine being able to breathe in such a black downpour.

Sunrise revealed a black flaky goo throughout the streets. Shovels and implements were passed about. Most of the trailers had one to keep sand from building along their corrugated sides. Everyone cleared as they thought best. Some started the streets, others the side walks. No one really talked, and I wondered if they though it was decent that West Point was so small, lest we have to shovel more of what seemed to be sweet smelling excrement.

I didn't really shovel much. I wanted to know why people weren't talking, I wanted to know their reaction. But I wondered in the seeming stunned silence was how people were keeping to themselves that something different actually happened at West Point.

The silence started to build as coarse as the desert sand until a ragged stranger waltzed into town, put a finger into the morass, and put it in his mouth. Everyone turned to him for a response.

"It's delicious." he said, and began to eat it by the handful. No one dared to do or say anything. No one really seemed to trust this new substance. I think we all expected for him to drop dead. This not happening, a town hall meeting was called at once. At twenty three I was not old enough to remember much about the last one, only that it had taken place in what we called "The Hut" which included our VFW, bar, casino, and rec room. The pool and poker tables were pushed aside for chairs so the whole town could sit and discuss.

After some wrangling the mayor finally got up and said, "So, what is it?"

"Is it food?"

"What food looks like that?"

"But the stranger says it's delicious."

"That doesn't mean it's anything."

"We should at least clean it up."

"But were do we put it?"

"In the sand."

"But why throw it away? It's food."

"Here. Here." The mayor stopped the crowd. It was clear why there hadn't been many town meetings in my day. The folk of West Point did much better whispering in secret over some beers than united in a group. What to do with this new wonder was probably something everyone would end up deciding for themselves, no matter what the mayor said.

"We ought to form parties to clear the public property, at least. But since we don't know what this is, I think the town members ought to decide how to do things best on their own land."

"I agree."

"Aye," came the rest of the town. It was certainly the solution that involved the least squabbling. No decision was really made about the stranger either, who spent much of the rest of the week telling tall tales, drinking beer, and eating the savory muck.

It was hard to deny the stranger's health was improving. He was a skeletal boy of 5'11" and probably a hundred and thirty pounds. In a week he went from protuding collar bones to a muscled chest. Rumors spread as always but reverberated little, involved as we all were at clearing the streets in the blazing heat and bickering over whether the thing was black manna, an ill omen or something splattered from space.

As progress was being made on the streets, another ill fated town hall meeting was called. A fair portion of the town wished to dump the goop into some kind of land fill and clear it up by the desert sands, but a one Mrs. Addison vehemently refused.

"Have you tried it?" she asked? Best food in the world if you ask me. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm all for leaving our own stuff on our own private land. She jerked her fist, involuntarily, and I could see her hand in her pocket, holding up a large set of jeans that were obviously not her size. I pondered this until it dawned on me that she'd lost weight, even moreso than our stranger had gained.

Murmurs rang throughout the hall. Again West Point lapsed into its inability to speak as a town, turning to gossips and confidants instead.

"If you have something to say, address the crowd," the mayor insisted.

"Well..." Hal Werner addressed the crowd, though seeming to lose his voice, "We don't really know what the stuff does. I haven't been so bold to eat it, and I don't think I will be, but maybe some might try it, and we can have a meeting next week."

Nearly everyone in the room secretly blessed Hal Werner, not merely for calling an end to the meeting but suggesting the there was nothing wrong with wanting to try this mysterious culinary substance whilst simultaneously suggesting it was ok to not want to try it. Addison, despite the obvious weight loss, which really only had one probable cause, might have been a pariah, but now the townsfolk felt at leisure to enjoy as much as they might want.

This state of airs lasted a day, when Atticus Rex delivered a scathing sermon on the dangers of hell. He was not an entirely fire and brimstone preacher, but only the dullest minds failed to noticed his sermons so frequently touched on the latest gossip, which a few pious souls in silent places never failed to tell him. He saved his dangers of hell when a rumor went around that particularly displeased him.

A rumor of particularly odiousness must have hit him, for this time he went so far as to describe hell in graphic detail. Usually he let phrases like eternal hell and everlasting fire, which caused fear reflexively, to do his work. Now he described torture implements, described the beast, and warned of the return of the Whore of Babylon.

His voice seemed a bit lower, his body and bit taller, his face more severe. The whole town was there to see that sermon, for in uncertain times one never neglected church attendance, and the response to authority banning something was predictable. A few souls were frightened out of their wits to try the goop, but the rest of us gave it a shot just to be contradictory. Or at least that's how I fancy it, because I didn't try it.

I was waiting for something a bit more solid than the endorsements of a complete stranger who seemed to care for nothing but loafing and Mrs. Addison. Mrs. Addison's invective was particularly damning. It was known amongst males of my age that she would sometimes approach younger men for no strings attached sex despite being married, possibly from some well hidden frustration with Mr. Addison.

The next week was amongst the most interesting in my life. As a journal writer and long observer of townsfolk, I noticed strange expressions on the faces of particular people. Smiles and frowns exchanged places on faces. Awkward strutting seemed to have come into fashion, for a few women looked about a dozen years younger and fifty pounds lighter. Something had clearly erased a decades worth of packaged hi-carb food. Prominent men looked nervous, geeks looked smug and confident. Sometimes these things were accompanied by a change of physical appearance, in other times there seemed to be no apparent cause.

The most memorable of these occasions was my invitation to a Wednesday night Bible study, something not seen since there had been three preachers in town. It was run by Amanda Ashton, of all people, who spoke eloquently of Biblical passages on love. And her baked from scratch chocolate chip cookies were so delictable as to make one believe that yes, there was a God and He did love us. It was every bit as inviting as our Sunday church service had been repelling.

It was the next day that proved to be the most memorable. Thursday had always been a particularly involved day for me, it was my casino day. Casino day on Thursday was lightly attended as most were waiting for Friday paychecks. But Thursday held a certain allure for those that could save up for it.

On Thursday Casino Night, no matter how much you lost, money was always coming in the next day. The players were not impulsive, and games often ground out for a long while rather than finishing in some grand gesture or spectacular failure. New Casino games were sometimes introduced Thursday nights, because of the small bets involved. In any case, it seemed to attract my kind of crowd. I usually made a few bucks which I tended to put away for next Thursday night.

This night I came up dead broke halfway through the night. I was certain someone had had some new found ability from the mud that was still trudged on the casino floor every now and then, but I couldn't tell which gambler to avoid and left early. I arrived in my trailer to see Mrs. Addison waiting for me, sitting on the couch in her husband's blue bathrobe. It was probably the only thing that fit her at this point.

She'd gone from a 300 pound woman in her late 40's to a 130 pound woman in her early twenties. Her tummy was flat and perfect and her chest spilled out of her robe. She was really only recognizable by her haircut and the fact that this was a logical conclusion to what eating the Black Rain had done to her.

"You want something to eat?" I asked.

"I need something to warm me up."

"Cocoa then? You're not getting any of my whiskey."

"Oh?" she asked, she seemed caught off guard. Something in her repulsed me a bit, something that made me hesitate in front of that flawless body.

"You know," I said, "It's funny. Some people are still hiding what they're eating. Even that they know that you do."

"People in this town are cowards. Don't know how to take what's right in front of them."

"Maybe they have a right to be cautious."

"Not caution. Cowardice. They do the things they fear behind closed doors."

"**Things?**"

"Yes," she said, "things." She was twirling her blue bathrobe in impatience.

I paused. I'd never had sex before and didn't want to blow it. But all my ponderings and observations seem to suggest some tension had to come before it. So I blurted out, dark smile on my face, "Do you think you'd ever be satisfied with one man again?"

I could hear a silent gasp. I'd guess correctly I wasn't the first man whose bed she'd pursued with her new figure. She blushed and looked away, clearly not nearly as confident in her new role as sex symbol just yet. She took a while to answer.

"No," she responded, turning back in defiance, licking her lips and making a come hither motion with her left finger.

"And why should you stay loyal to someone whose offered love has been feeble and with whom you have no children?"

"Lie with me," she whispered.

I began to notice a pattern of arousal in her each time I offered up something that I wondered she might be having trouble admitting herself, and I remained standing.

"And why shouldn't it be a good time to question loyalty? You've seen it change based on physical appearance, and now your appearance has changed..."

"Be gentle with me, please."

"You didn't come here to be gentle," I said, and kissed her on the cheek. Then I looked into those eyes. They said "take me" like her words never could. Then it was lips, breasts, hair, wetness violently rolling over the floor until a heartstopping explosion not much latter.

"You put up a good fight," she said.

Beginner's luck, I figured. I'd heard enough female to female conversations to know what they liked was hard to describe. Something about being mysteriously harsh seemed to tickle it. I would make a note in my journal about it at some point.

She left about as she as she arrived, no doubt to keep our meeting private. I greatly regretted it, being post-coitus punch drunk and no one to talk to. I felt a sudden lightness that made it simple to get things off my chest and unclog my mind.

The act was nothing like I imagined. I had long fantasized of having a harem of girls, all waiting patiently for my sexual whim because I was me. They fawned every moment over every fiber of my being, living only for my satisfaction. The real act had been a bit... antagonistic, like a conquest for lack of a better word. I supposed that's why I halted and took a harsh though not abusive tone. I didn't quite know what I was doing, but it didn't set still for me to pursue sex too freely given.

All this worried me. The harem fantasy and my swift consumation. I was not concerned with the act itself, but worried about the consequences of another Mrs. Addison, also consuming Black Liquid Lust and showing up amongst the mobile homes of every man she could lay their hands on. Sex, as I knew from my lone fantasies and my current night, was not an activity that generally encouraged sharing.

I had let her go, knowing she was off to the arms of another man, but leaving a bruise in a part of her mind I expected no one else could touch. But I wondered what vendettas would be piling up, as her men fought for control of her. Not that I suspected they would ever control her now, as long as that strange tar still clogged the streets.

------------------------------------

The next week, for the first time I had known West Point, gossiping ceased. Given the increasingly voluptuous appearance of several other women, and newly charming and muscle bound men, I imagined that the town's night life had been so active that no one talked for fear they had some secret shame to be discussed shortly.

Big gossips seem to come in two varieties. The ones deflecting shameful attention from themselves and those that had no shame to hide and were building themselves up on the humiliations of others. At least these were my observations. Whatever their motives, they were all embarassingly quiet.

It struck me, however, that rivalries would be breaking out in other forms throughout the town. I did not know how many had guessed that this new precipitation might be a wish-granting fluid of some kind. How much of life, I began to preoccupy myself with, involved the possession of things that could not be shared?

Of particular interest to me was the conflict I foresaw between Amanda and Atticus. Both had upped their ante it seemed. Amanda gave her first talk at her Bible study, a three minute observation on the subject of forgiveness. I honestly don't know if anyone could pay attention to it over the sound of consuming their own brownies. On my first bite I admit to staring at mine, wondering if she knew how to break the laws of physics to fit more chocolate in than was possible by Nature's laws alone.

In any case, discussion on the topic of Jesus was light and carefree without being trite and shallow. Inspirational quotes that you wanted to think about throughout the week. Atticus on the other hand had seemed to acquire a new poetic flair for descriptions of sin, hellfire, and now sexual promiscuity. West Point's Sundays seemed destined to be filled with terror, even as Monday rolled around and the town rolled back to beer, gambling, and the new sport of sneaking off for fornication at any time it was convenient.

Wednesday rolled around for another meeting at Amanda's, which now required a guest list in order that services should be able to fit in her trailer. I signed up for next week and went back to Thursday gambling. I had been correct in picking out the two rather improved gamblers and by avoiding them all night managed to put some money back in my gambling / book fund.

I returned to my trailer to find Ms. Addison waiting on me. She was wearing loose jeans and an oversized t-shirt, I thought looking not to provoke. I wondered if I should tell her that no clothes were going to hide her endowment but decided against it. She wanted me alone for some reason, though I wasn't quite sure for what.

"Elmer kicked me out of the trailer," she told me, before I had much time to register her presence. She'd helped herself to a full saucepan of Blackness and my biggest spoon, and was taking massive helpings that she swallowed all once, from time to time wiping her face with her fingers and taking the opportunity to lick them seductively.

"You wish to stay here?"

"No, no, I'm sure I'll find a place."

"I... how much of that stuff do you eat?" I asked.

"Well, it's around four saucepans, but I'm wondering maybe five." Addison replied, again wiping her lips.

"So the um... weight loss is temporary?" I tried to make sense of it.

"I don't think it will reverse or anything. It's just that I've got competition."

"I noticed," I said with that harsh tone from last time.

"Someone else proposition you?" she asked, intrigued.

"Not yet. It just occurred to me that you wouldn't be the only one this would happen to and that fact would be..." I tried to put some sass in like last time, "problematic. Need more ingredients to compete? Your appearance hasn't changed.

"But my body has," she corrected. Then she stood, raised her jeans to reveal her feet, which were oddly curling. She gradually lifted airborne, balancing her entire weight on her upright toes. Slowly the lifted one of her legs into vertical splits. Two thoughts instantly flashed into my head. "I hope those legs are spread for me" and "How the hell is she balancing herself with all that weight on her chest? I could feel a lust rising, which I kept internal, for I remembered how essential a little waiting, a little antagonism had once carried the day.

"But can you pireoutte?" I asked, and then without much warning pulled her arm so that the only thing she could do to keep her balance was spin.

"Hey, you asshole!" she interjected at first.

"Spin, spin girl. Show off your body's grace and charm."

She spun around several times, not losing her supernatural balance, even as I jerked her to keep the spinning going.

"I'm a... a ballerina!" She smiled. "But you'll have to catch me!" Whilst spinning she swung her leg down, which I had to instinctively dodge to not get kicked in the groin. She leaned over, ready to fall and I jumped in place to catch her. I caught her by her loose sweater before tucking an arm under her back.

She laughed, heartily, and without any indication she could stop. Over the course of several minutes she almost seemed ready to double over in pain.

A loud and insistent knock startled me. I was certain after that little stunt Ms. Addison would be happy to stay a while for company which I so rarely received. I supposed I had about a 2% chance of guessing who lay behind that door. It wasn't Atticus. He would have approached me in church.

"Amanda?" I asked. She was weeping.

"I heard laughter," she said quietly. I didn't think she was trying to pin some adultery gossip on me, especially given recent events. She looked miserable.

"You want some cocoa?" I asked.

"That would be wonderful," she said, taking my hand up my trailer's rickety stairs. We went, hand in hand to my kitchen, me guiding her in the low light. She retracted her arm and spouted "Her!" Looking over at the splurging saucepan of blackness and the little black stain on Mrs. Addison's oversized sweater I realized I hadn't really prepared for respectable company.

"Relax. It's her night off." The truth of that statement remained to be seen, but Mrs. Addison's ragged clothes and general undolled appearance, coupled with the explosive laughter seemed to soothe her a bit. She sat down and drank her cocoa. As hormones were raging in the area, and Amanda had something of a wholesome image to uphold, I asked.

"It's about a man, isn't it?"

"Is it that obvious?" she asked. She obviously wanted it a secret.

"It's the damn slime, that's how I know. It's affected people. Mrs. Addison and I were just talking about that."

Sensing my tact and coming to my aid, she said. "It's really hard to talk to anyone but Timothy about it. But he kind of gets it."

"I don't think this stuff does what people think it does," I stated.

"Oh?" Amanda looked curious.

"People think it only turns you into a sex object but I think it does something different," I told her. "I think it might reflect something in your heart. Being lonely is so very difficult and I imagine, for people who've had poor sex lives I think it manifests as an ability to attract the opposite sex, and with so much of it lying everywhere, I think a few men and women are making the night a little, interesting."

"I didn't mean to," Amanda whispered.

"But everything felt so perfect, like everything was meant to be..." Mrs. Addison added.

Amanda wailed and hid her head in her hands. "That was my line," I whispered. It was clear the words changed based on who said them.

"You're a woman, Amanda. Certain things turn you on." I told her.

"It was too easy. I gave in so quickly. You. Mrs. Addison doesn't seemed to have swayed you." Amanda noted.

"Well not tonight," I responded.

"Oh, well that does make me feel better... I mean, not like that." Amanda corrected.

"I know. Everyone's having this problem, not just you," I told her

"Then how do I stop it?"

"When a tempter comes to the door, talk about smashing penises, if you can manage it," I smiled.

"I suppose that would do," Amanda smiled weakly.

"I don't even think people would hold it against you, not with those Bible study dessert trays I've had the pleasure of sampling."

Upon saying it I seemed to have found her cheeriness button.

"You've liked them?" she asked unexpectantly. "I think, you know, that Atticus, well, he's not really capturing the whole spirit of the religion I think. I mean, we're going to have to face our sins and all but I think we're given blessings here on earth too. And you know it hasn't escaped my notice that when it wasn't necessarily safe to be a Christian, when things were all uncertain and dangerous there were certain women that really stood up, and I thought, you know. I'm sorry I didn't invite you this time, that won't happen again."

"Well, you don't want to play favorites." I told her.

"But, I don't know what I would have done... you saved them. There's no denying it. Maybe you could be, you know, a guardian for it, if you want."

"Sounds lovely." Mrs. Addison noted, after being silent for sometime. "I'm going to go back to my husband I suppose. I'm sure he's suspicious in times like these... but what were you laughing at?"

I signaled for Mrs. Addison to repeat her previous gesture of flexibility. Again she climbed to the tip of her toes, again she lifted her knee to her head.

"Spin her," I told her, and with reluctance Amanda grabbed Mrs. Addison's arms and made her twirl a bit. The humor had somewhat worn off on the struggling ballerina but Amanda let out a throaty laugh as sweet as any of her divinely inspired baked goods, and then hurried out of my trailer.

"You know," Mrs. Addison stared rather lovingly at me, "I wanted a wild, promiscuous sex life, but I think I like this better. My nights with you. Mind if I move in?"

"Not a problem Mrs. Addison."

"Sylvia."

-----------------------------------

West Point was to become a split world for me. I was an observer by nature. I had to think, had to riddle, had to record, it was part of my nature. There was no doubt that Sylvia took a certain edge off, but it was there still, and she never disturbed my writing.

Outside my trailer the world had become a little different. No longer could my role as passive observer be excepted, but everyone seemed to want to put me in a different role. Elmer, the husband, nursed a well earned grudge and from Sylvia's betrayal and refused any sort of divorce. If she wanted other men, it would have to be in sin, he exclaimed. The town quickly pieced together we were in a monogamous relationship, which pleased just about everyone but a few men who had whispered things to Sylvia in the night that they dared not have repeated.

The men in town saw me as the one who tamed her, and had a certain fear of me. The women looked at me as the one who restored her virtue, in some way that they didn't really have words for. I, a reader, had the right word for her. I had taken a mistress. I played a prominent role at Amanda's bible studies and no one let on, in front of her, any moral distaste for me. I was, in short, the macho man that conquered the untamable woman, the effeminate man that prefer to read over booze and poker, the moral man of Amanda's Wednesdays, and the moral outrage for living so openly and unrepentantly with a married woman.

It was this last category I grew a secret concern about, and not because I cared if that was the general sentiment of the town. I grew concerned it was the opinion of Atticus Rex. Something did not sit right with me about the man. He had always had a solid, unreadable expression, though this was something you forgot because, as an orator, he had such an expressive voice. I couldn't shake that something was wrong in him. Of course, all I really had of his mind and opinions I acquired from his sermons. He did not accept my company in any other construct.

Atticus had been the undisputed religious leader in the town for well over seven years. His sermons were always rather literal. He clearly thought of sin in terms of rather specific acts, and didn't open himself up much for interpretation. I wondered if this might indeed be a weakness of his, that he was so direct as a person he would have neglected implications others could see in his sermons, implications that betrayed his personal feelings. The tone of his sermons had grown perceptibly darker, and I journaled them because some ache told me there was something the matter.

Thus I began recording the contents of his sermons, the books and chapters of scripture he cited, and paid attention to the biblical characters whose actions he chose to spotlight. It was not hard to pick up on his habit of using the term "The Whore of Babylon" as a specific reference to Sylvia. I was reading the Bible a bit more now, and noted every mention of this figure was incongrous with the spirit of the biblical prophecy. I think he just liked the term whore, but dared not use it directly upon someone who was incomprehensively popular among some women in the town.

If I may add a note, before the Black Rains, being a mistress in West Point would have been a terrible burden and secret. But there were still men and women, and we all knew who they were, sneaking out for gobs of goop to fuel sexual romps with members of married couples. And we all knew how ferocious tempters and temptresses they were. While I preferred the more direct title of mistress for Sylvia, the more conservative referred to my **unconventional** relationship. I think they noticed to, the ease and happiness with which a new unofficial religious leader, Amanda, felt in her company. These were reasons enough for Sylvia to return to respectable society in a way unthinkable two years ago.

I might add that Sylvia's acceptance and even mild popularity were infuriating to Atticus. Whilst it was pretty much accepted the everyone in town, no matter how enticing or unattractive, had carried on an affair, they all viewed these acts as sinful, and guilt over sinful acts brought people to his services, looking for some sort of absolution.

Within about two months the character of his sermons most certainly changed, as one fateful night a Friday night gambler shot another over a disputed debt. This suggested that gambling, not infidelity, was a more pressing problem. Amanda arranged a silent vigil--a new practice in West Point--while Atticus took over the traditional funeral services.

The wind in Atticus' sails came back. It wasn't talked about, but I think it was secretly guessed, that a few gamblers had gotten some swagger from the rain. They played better and won big, until the shooting at least. But far too many people had gotten attached to the muck for it really to be practical to convince the town to get rid of it. Even Sylvia, who had by now firmly settled in with me, I'd caught swallowing a few spoonfuls from time to time, "In case those wenches get any ideas." (They did.)

I suspected too that Amanda's ability to please as a hostess, as well as keep an unorganized religious meeting on track, most certainly had its origins in that substance. She was doing a real service to the community, offering comfort and solace. But I couldn't help but notice how much she enjoyed being admired and respected, and her sudden flair for theology seemed a bit unnatural. I'd never observed it in her before. I didn't concern myself with it. I thought of it as her dirty little secret, although not dirty in the shameful sense. I did not think she would be anxious to be rid of it.

Atticus insisted we be rid of it. That it was a sign of our moral decay. We undertook the task immediately--the task, that was, of fooling Atticus that we had any intention of moving it. As the town's less than silent observer estimated, there were probably about 75% of the town taking it. I picked out about 5 male and 3 female temptresses still in our midst, 3 or 4 gamblers, 7 to 10 businessmen, and dozens of people who were happy in their own private way. West Point was a dangerous place at night, but I gather much more pleasant in the day. It was a new town, and too much had happened to go back.

It was too in keeping with Atticus' sermons that the one on idleness was the clear evidence he knew we were slacking off. I knew it, Sylvia knew it, and above all, Amanda knew it. I hadn't said anything to her about it, but, during a packed Friday gambling night, she came scrambling into my trailer with the black substance smeared all over her dress. Friday night was a private night, for those who did not drink, dance, or gamble, and Amanda barged into the middle one of my love making sessions that was my typical Friday night activity.

"I have to..." she scrambled for words, "go to the bathroom."

I had no idea what to say, and Sylvia did nothing to hand over her a wooden spoon, presumably for consuming what was left on her clothes.

"You're hungry," Sylvia said, smiling giddily without breaking expression.

Amanda was beat red, standing next to a naked woman who felt no self-consciousness whatsoever.

"You don't understand," Sylvia continued. "I know hunger. There is hunger in the belly, hunger in the loins, hunger in the mind, and yes, hunger in the soul. And there is gobs of that great discovery or accident, and it goes down smooth and tastes delicious. But it doesn't satisfy. I was hungry for the sexual approval of every man I'd ever met. I ate it straight from sauce pans with a wooden spoon when I was too embarrassed to keep eating it with my hands. But then one day I cared about the sexual approval of one man," she kissed me softly.

"Your flock," Sylvia continued, "you worry about them so. And now you want to make sure your legendary cheeriness does not fade, your newly discovered intellect, your delicious baked goods which I'm sure have a rather obvious secret ingredient."

Amanda didn't say a word, but slowly scooped up the smears with her wooden spoon and ate them there giggling while we grabbed some blankets for modesty's sake.

"He's splitting the town in two," she replied. "I go to church too, so I see attendance to both events, and I can see the invitations being refused are the people that show up to his services without fail. My service is on a Wednesday night, Wednesday, so people can steal my left over baked goods for when there's no money on Thursday. The easiest day to come, next to a Sunday. I never meant to compete with him."

"Not competition the way you're thinking about it. But you thought something was missing from the services." I told her.

"That's how he looks at it, isn't it?" Amanda asked.

"I've been observing Atticus quite closely over the past few months. There is something in him that I'm having difficulty placing. He's losing to his own hunger, whatever it's for."

"Hmm..." Amanda looked perplexed at her empty mug of cocoa. "I've been writing short passages as I think of them, but I think there's something I'll have to address in the present."

"Good luck," I offered, as she left my trailer looking for her own and her husband. It was the last time I saw her alive. Ever the journalist, I've compiled evidence of what has happened. Sometime around 3:30 there was a ferocious blast, which I struggled to identify at that hour of the night. Within a few minutes a gunshot was fired, and followed by an additional round several minutes later.

Amanda Ashton was found dead in her bed, from a shotgun blast which nicked Mr. Ashton's left shoulder. Mr. Ashton rolled off the side of the bed, drew a 9mm pistol with which he shot the preacher Atticus Rex in the stomach. Mr. Ashton claims Mr. Rex subsequently dropped the shotgun, pleaded for his life and then attempted to rearm himself and was shot in the throat, which he died shortly thereafter.

Mr. Ashton called to report the murder and what he and his lawyers have claimed was self defense. Mr. Ashton reports the final encounter as follows, that his wife had left the light on to work on a religious speech of some kind for her Wednesday bible meeting. He claims Mr. Rex shot her in the head while she was turned away from him. Upon drawing his own gun, Ashton recalls Rex pleading with him explaining his desire to kill two more people openly living in sin. Had said people needed the fear of God in them again. Mr. Ashton responded simply, "So do you," and shot him in the stomach. Upon appearing dead, Mr. Rex attempted to arm himself and shot Mr. Ashton again, who then fatally wounded him.

Both Mr. Rex and Mrs. Ashton returned from an autopsy with a strange substance in their digestive system, a substance which littered the streets of West Point. The substance was in Mrs. Ashton's upper GI tract, and examiner estimates a meal of the substance approximately five hours before the shooting. Mr. Rex's entire digestive tract was full of the substance. The coroner believes he had been eating at a regular pace since eight in the previous morning, and trails in the esophagus indicate a large imbibing of the substance right before the shooting. Strangely, the substance does not seem to have any clear toxic or intoxicating properties that might have altered anyone's behavior before the incident.

Being Mrs. Ashton's silent protege the general agreement was that I prepare her last rites. I made preparation for a silent vigil, as she had done, and refused to bring in a minister for an official burial. I gave no reason for this arrangement, though those that best know the events of that night understand I wished her passing to in no way resemble what Mr. Rex would have done, if they were his procedings.

"Being shot from behind, Amanda left no parting words, but she had scribbled a few lines on a speech she wished to deliver during her Bible study. "What profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his own soul? The answer of course is, (smile here to indicate joke) the world. But it is a different world to the soulless. It will not be enough, and the possessor of the new world will want more worlds--worlds that can only be generated from his own head. These worlds, fullest of a soulless imagination, will not contain anything that is not perverted, or which is satisfying, necessitating the creation of more worlds of equal fruitlessness.

"A hunger for a food that can never satisfy--that is what the soulless inherits. But I hold as idle fantasy those stories about selling your soul to the devil, because a sale implies a quick and decisive purchase. One loses one's soul not by a contract in blood, signed once, but by every day filling it with hunger until...

"The note," I informed the audience, "ends here, and considering the note in detail, I hope that it is never finished, for only one who can knows the hunger can tell of what she set out to describe. I can only imagine..." here I failed to offer a timeline, "That given her new found voice, her caring, her leadership in these strange times--that hunger has been replaced by the beautiful woman we'll always keep in our memories."

I had observed, journaled, pondered the human spirit in a handwriting that no one else would ever understand. I wondered, in that strange moment, if that had only been practice for the one time I would have to address my entire town. I go back now to contemplating words likely never to be read.

I know Atticus Rex was after myself and Sylvia next, and so I can't help but feel I should be able to describe his motives. He was a preacher that believed in the benefits of a fear of God, that humans could not be moral creatures without an awareness of their upcoming judgment. But putting the fear of God into someone who does not have it is certainly a tricky business. Particuarly when the Black Rain came.

It was impossible in the time of the Black Rain for anyone to stop, by old standards, an epidemic of infidelity. The Black Rain, when imbibed by those who strongest urge was lust, created sex symbols beyond my wildest imaginings that creatures of the flesh were overpowered by. I know I did not resist it. I spent many hours a week making love to a voluptuous woman and it never lost its appeal, it was never less ecstatic, and I trampled on social convention to continue it, and I imagine everyone else did at some point.

There was more to it than sex. Some hungry gamblers poached victims at the card tables, but I do think this escaped Rex's notice. I think he saw the rampant sex, unblessed by a marital union, and nothing he seemed to be able to do about it. Then came Amanda, groping for a solution. We didn't know where the future of West Point was. But we saw its present, saw us coming together on a Wednesday night when most of us were at each other's throats. Her solution did not involve fear of God because she wasn't afraid of God. Everyone knows Atticus tried to put it in her, but I think her heart always short circuited the attempt. Atticus solution was drizzling a slow demise.

But murder? It took a long time for me to try to connect the Rex vision of the future into something that could only be saved by Amanda's death. After long reflection I realized I was not looking at the picture correctly. Then those moments of hunger I had seen came back to me, as did the autopsy report. Atticus was hungry, and when I saw that all things fell into place. Atticus did not care about putting the fear of God into anyone. He cared about putting the fear of Atticus Rex into everyone. The pulpit had only been a socially acceptable place to do so. I have recently taken to imagining Atticus Rex reading with great interest the Biblical account of hell, and knowing implicitly if not explicitly that he would create his greatest fear amongst those gathered in pews.

Failing this, I think he conceived the notion of himself as the deranged gunman, and that fated morning he either gorged this Sodom's new culinary feast, perhaps waffling on whether or not to do the blasted deed, or hoping there was some secret recipe in it for his success. Well, he did succeed. Atticus' memory invokes fear here a great deal, but he did not live to see it. Nor, I might add, did he live to see the generation of children raised at the Amanda K. Ashton Memorial Orphanage, an idea taken from a scribble in Amanda's notes. Already she had clearly seen the mess that might occur to a generation which could never be sure of its paternal descent. My children have friends there.
