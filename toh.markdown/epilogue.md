### The Epilogue, Creed's career change and new family. 

### Epilogue

"Jonny?" Dr. Creed's uncle asked him warmly.

"Yes, it's me uncle."

"Welcome, I... I only cleaned up my office for one. Who'd you bring in tow?"

"My..." Creed stumbled for words. Girlfriend? Lover? He and Electra hadn't discussed their situation with anyone else. "My family." Creed decided on.

"Very distant relations."

"My new family. This is Electra, and her daughter Cora."

"You elope or something?"

"Well, no... things just sort of happened. She's pregnant." 

"And you're the father? My brother will be scandalized. I knew there was some decadence hiding under that dry academic exterior. Cora a child from a different father?" he asked Electra. 

"Oh. Well yes."

"You were also unmarried at the time?"

"Yes. Well..."

"You'll have to fill me in on the details sometime. Cora looks restless. You want to play with my smart phone? I'm sure there's some games on it somewhere?"

Electra winced just a bit, and Cora snatched the phone with great eagerness. "She's never used one before. They're dangerous."

"Dangerous? No one's tracing the phone on this old codger. I'm to old to cause anyone any trouble."

"I suppose it's all right. Go on, Cora, you're allowed."

To Creed's surprise she'd been waiting for her mother's permission to use the phone, even as impatient as she was to get it. He looked back at his uncle's puzzled look. "Electra works in IT. So she's wary of those sorts of things."

"I see." Creed's Uncle could tell there was a story that he might not want to hear. "So what leads to the visit? Not that you can't just come and visit." 

"We're wanting to settle down somewhere... quiet."

"In the past I would have suggested your bedroom." 

Electra let out a brief laugh of light mirth. Then she gave Creed a kiss on the check. "He's a catch." 

"Hmmm... somewhere quiet. You done adventuring?" 

"Well, I found my treasure." Creed replied, taking Electra's hand in his.

"You two look cute. Love always makes you look younger, for some reason or another. So, you can't go back to your previous university job, but I'm guess you're looking to teach Greek again?" 

"It's what I'm qualified to do. Only my abrupt departure might make things difficult. I thought someone with your reputation."

"I might know of an opening? No, it's not my field. And besides, didn't you leave abruptly because you were a tad miserable?"

"A different university. Surely things would be different at another university." 

"I've been thinking about that."

"You have?"

"Since we watched that film. The Numerologist Can't Stop the Bees, remember?"

"I remember it, no that you mention it. That seems ages ago." 

"So I've been looking into that field. I think it's hogwash. People trying to explain things with numbers without having to resort to reality. But it does point to a sort of sexiness with numbers. Oh, they strike people as quite boring, but there is something in knowing 2 and 2 will always equal four, or a right triangle will always have the same proportions, no matter what culture you belong to or religion to which you believe in. I feel like numerologists are physicists that haven't found their place. Their evidence to examine."

"That film made quite an impression on you."

"Didn't it make an impression on you? Didn't you wonder why we saw that film in particular?"

"I don't think I'll puzzle out anything from what I saw."

"I went back over your paper. The one you've been trying to publish that no one wants?"

"Oh?"

"You're trying to come up with a biography of a figure so old, it's hard to know if he was merely a legend, even in the era where from Greek texts do survive. Even just a letter, or a journal entry, if it could be traced to him, might undo any narrative you might build around him now, based on the evidence." 

"Such a fascinating puzzle, isn't it?"

"Yes. But a puzzle for you, no? You're a teacher. Hasn't it struck you that in order to advance in your career you might have to teach about a puzzle that's interesting to others? That to excite your students you have to find a problem that's relevant to them?"

"Well, that makes sense Uncle, but what puzzle are you referring to?"

"There are other important texts in Greek besides the classics."

"The Bible? Definitely some important stuff in Greek. But... you're a skeptic, aren't you?" 

"For my survival, of course. You can't teach the history of science without knowing how scientists think. But you teach science and you never run out of faith-oriented types that want to discuss what science can't answer. I consider that a distraction from my own area of expertise. But it might be a gig worth taking on."

"But I'm not Christian either."

"You know, there are some people that seek out people they disagree with. It's hard, of course, to deal with someone when you can't even agree on the basics. My brother, your father, for instance. Never believed happiness should trump propriety in relationships. Believes you can't go on living until that's 'fixed'. But that's not something I'm going to do. But sometimes people don't always think disagreeements need to be fixed. That life can go on if someone you know doesn't believe what you do. And let's face it. If you want to be looking at a legend beyond the texts, Jesus is a solid bet. You know the Greek. What do you think?"

"You know, I just dealt with this dilemma before..."

"There's so much trailing off in your voice. Are you back in the present yet."

"It was a conundrum. I was given a choice. I could give my life to save an ancient text, or save myself and trust in a less detailed version that survived to the present day."

"Which did you pick?"

"Well, I'm still here. So, teaching Biblical Greek. That's a change in direction."'

"Any more than going to Greece and bringing back a lady? You will, Electra, have to tell me how he seduced you?"

"Him, seduce me?" she responded in amusement. "What have you been telling your uncle?"

"Hmm... she's feisty."

"A girl can't always tell a guy has what counts. Jonathon does."

"Well, Jonny boy, you've won a lady's heart. And I'm sworn to secrecy regarding your marital status. You might think of hatching a plan should you tell your good and proper father. Maybe you should tell him she's your mail order bride?"

"Uncle."

"Ok, even I'd have troubles keeping a straight face on that one. But if you're off to teach at a religious college you might want to appear more traditional." 

"Noted. I'll have a few more stories to tell, some day. And who knows? Maybe another adventure."
