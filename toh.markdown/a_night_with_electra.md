"So, is Cora asleep?" Dr. Creed asked.

"Yes, so peaceful too. I'm certain she won't stir until morning. What she's been through I might imagine a fitful sleep... but I think she's just tired. We can worry about dealing with her in the morning."

"So going to be ok, with this?"

"I don't know. She'll have to be at some point. Life goes on. Everyone realizes they're mortal at some point. For me it was even earlier."

"Really? You haven't talked about your past much."

"I can't believe I said that. Umm... can we talk about something else?"

"Something else, huh?" Dr. Creed asked. His mind had been so preoccupied about survival, safety, and keeping from panicking he hadn't much time for reflection. He look up at the ceiling to Electra's apartment. There was a high window for light in the day, but everything outside was black. Only a single bear bulb had things illuminated now. 

"Anything?" She asked again, eager to change the subject.

"That, that dream I had, did I tell you about that?"

"Dream?" she asked. 

"The... I don't know if this happened to you, but they gave me some sort of liquid. They called it the blood of Apollo."

"Did you drink it?"

"It was an injection, actually."

"They wanted you to see something?"

"Maybe I should give up figuring out what they want, but I did see something?"

"What?"

"An ancient library. Shelf after shelf of scrolls. Papyrus probably. I could only imagine it to be the one at Alexandria, from what I saw."

"Was it detailed?"

"Detailed?"

"Do you remember things clearly? In a dream things get foggy. But they gave you a shot. That's different."

"You're right. I remember everything. I was at the entrance to the library. A woman came to greet me. She worked for the library. I thought that was odd. You wouldn't think of a female librarian back then. It was a little later I found out the reason for her employment."

"Daddy wants his girl to follow in her footsteps?" She asked teasingly. 

"She was there to make foreign scholars welcome, if you know what I mean."

"Of course I know what you mean. Those ancient scholars and their symposiums. They want to get drunk and laid just like anybody else, so they have to invent this sophisticated ritual of philosophy so they don't lose their image."

"Of course their minds were very focused on their ideas. So, you, just hire a woman to take care of things..."

"So was she capable? Or did she get the job through other assets?"

"Her robe was quite large and thick. But there was something about her smile. It seemed untouched by the world. There was some kind of indescribable purity in it."

"Hmm... guys love purity. You know, when it's theirs to ruin."

"She was alluring and attractive. Is that what you want to hear me say? Yes, she was. I was of course there, in my normal American clothes, which she found fascinating."

"Ready to take them off?"

"Oh, that was part of her job description to be certain. But she thougt it might be quite profitable for American merchants to trade there, and curious about the cloth. Denim would have been royal attire back then. In any case, she took me through the library. This was a scholar's dream. Scroll after scroll, any of which could have made an academic career, laid out floor to ceiling on neat, wooden shelves. She suggested one for me."

"Did you read it?"

"I did."

"And?"

"It was a story about the Tower of Babel. Only older, and in more detail. From someone shall we say, closer to the event? The story is inverted. In the beginning, the world's languages had already scattered. A king, and his descendants, believe if they can build one language, their kingdom will rule forever. So they construct a temple, which he block being a 'word stone'. It was a work of many generations. The end was in sight. After so much work had been done, those who were constructing the temple, how had been divided by their language in the past, could talk to each other. When they could converse, they realized what they had been saying about each other. You know, how each group was the 'chosen people', how everyone else were 'mud people', you know, how every culture has it's own smugness and arrogance to it. In the end, they all went to war, over the honor of who should destroy the temple."

"So there was a bigger-dick battle?" 

"What? Oh, yes, I guess you could call it that. They didn't like the judgments passed. So they destroyed the temple. In the Biblical story God kind of crushes their pride. In this story there needed be no divine intervention. A uniting project failed because people couldn't forgive their own judgments. The original seemed so much more satisfying than the one passed down to the Hebrew writers. But then something happened. Remember miss librarian with the thick robe?"

"What happened with her?"

"She wasn't what she appeared. Underneath her robe she had ten more arms, each carrying a flame. The Library was going to go up in flames, just as history demanded it would. Her robe was fire retardant, and she gave me a choice. I could place the scroll under the robe, in which case it would survive until the present day. Or I could put myself under the robe and live. There was no telling this as a dream or a real event. I didn't think I'd make up. So I gave up the scroll for another day, for something else. It sounds like the obvious choice, but I thought about dying for the scroll. I represented everything I wanted from going into academia in the first place, I wondered if I would ever get over the loss. But I didn't have much time to choose."

"Wow," Electra said, and averted her gaze. She reached up and rubbed the side of her neck. Creed thought she might be stiff.

"Are you sore?" Creed asked with concern.

"Well, not that sore."

"Here, let me help, things have been awfully rough."

"Sure."

Creed began massaging her shoulders. "You are a bit tense."

"Military prison can do that to a lady."

"So what," Dr asked, continuing the massage, "could I have chosen myself? Did I just choose to save my own skin? I don't think so..." Creed stopped mid-sentence like he'd been cracked in the jaw. Electra had been hanging on his every word, listening with great intent. In the silence he expected Electra to say something. But she didn't. As he looked down into her big brown eyes for some sort of indication, the answer became apparent. A sudden sense of panic flooded his brain. He remembered the look on the face on that ancient librarian, "the scroll or your life". It did not resemble Electra's face in the slightest, except for the demand, "Now or never." It didn't take much time to decide. He leaned in and gave her a kiss. 

What am I doing? He asked himself for a moment. He hadn't even been able to get his bearings. He was certain his job at the university was hopelessly gone. Now that he'd met up with Electra, he'd been in a rolling state of perpetual danger. Any pairing would of course would put him in a quasi father role, something he wasn't prepared for. And yet, his locked his lips with hers.

They kissed with a sort of graceless ease, as if they'd done it many times before, and shortly, he went to slip his tongue in, and she bit it. Not hard, but enough to make him retreat.

"You... you..." he could barely get it out, "bit me!" He was confused, angry, frightened, aroused, and couldn't fight back an impulse to knock her over. He did, however, see himself about to do it, stopped in the middle and caught her halfway. She looked like she'd just been dipped by an elegant dancer.

"Oh my..." Electra gasped. 

"You like things gentle, or rough?" He teased her. 

"Both. Though this is the first time I think someone's tried them both."

"Well then good. He said, looking down at her. Because I still want to finish our conversation."

"Oh really? I can't get the scholar in you to shut up?" 

He leaned in to kiss her. An intoxicating surge of power built in him, something he'd never felt with any other woman. They'd all been tedious or unsatisfying, and he could never figure out why. In a moment like this, he could explore any fantasy he wished. Not that they would necessarily go do it, but it wouldn't ruin the moment. The passion would find some other outlet, some other fantasy or exploratory path, and that would be thrilling. He felt free and shameless, both from her and toward her. 

"No. No. No. I want to banter a bit," he said. 

"Maybe I should have bit your tongue harder." she whispered.

"Maybe I'll let you bite my some more. If you're into that kind of thing."

"You seem into it."

"I don't know if I am. But it got us here. And I like here."

"Oh, what do you like about it?" 

"I like taunting you. Teasing you."

"Talk, talk, talk." 

He let go of her. He did not intend to drop her. She a had a hold on him, so he just planned on trying to keep his balance. It wasn't a particular well thought out maneuver. She wasn't prepared to hold on, and then grabbed him quickly just before she fell. This sent him stumbling forward. His stumble loosened her grip, and she tried to grab back on, but he instead of grabbing by the hip, as she had before, she grabbed his knee. pulling the rest of his leg with it. This threw him completely off balance and backward. He fell on the floor with her on top of him. 

He was a bit dazed from the fall, but she locked lips with him again. He thought the fall should have hurt him a bit more but he didn't feel much of anything. He waited to hear Cora wake up from the fall, but there wasn't a peep. 

"Ah, now I'm on top. It's a good thing..." she paused to go after him, "because I don't trust men." 

"Undress me." Creed responded. 

Electra did as instructed, unbuttoning Creed's shirt. "We really need to get you acclimated to the Mediterrenean Sun, if you're to stay here." 

"I want you to fuck me." he'd never been able to say that so calmly and without pretense. 

"Do, you? Is that what you want?"

"Fuck me." There was no mistaking it for a question. It was clearly a command. It was hard, at this moment, to quite tell who was in control of the situation. Physically, she was on top, but psychologically he was making the advances. He could have rolled over, and she would have surrendered. But he didn't want her to surrender, there was something thrilling in the struggle. Electra took off her shirt.

"Who said you could do that?" He asked. 

"I did. You going to stop me?" She retorted, and even in the darkness he could see a fiendish glint in her eye. Then he looked down and saw a thin three inch scar across her stomach. He put his curosity about it behind him, and in his mood, it was damn sexy. 

"Go on." she undid his pants, and pulled out his member.

"My, my." she said, someone's excited. 

He tried to cover a little embarrassment with a grin. If there was going to be anything to ruin the evening, it wasn't going to be his throbbing veiny package. 

She pulled off his pants and then looked at him, a little dazed. 

"Something wrong?" He asked. 

"Oh... you're circumsized!" she giggled. 

He grabbed her by the hair. "That a problem?"

"Should make things interesting." she replied, touching the tip of it with her tongue. She was soft, but Creed had a stunning realization of how sensitive the area was. She didn't put it in her mouth, but spread it with her saliva and stroked it while she slid out of her pants. There was only one article of clothing left. Creed looked it her as if inquiring if she was losing her nerve. This look was rewarded by her throwing her panties in his face. The aroma bombarded him and he felt a little trickle come out from his member. 

"Was that a...?" apparently a preejaculation was something that she'd read about but never seen before. 

"It's a sign you're taking too long. He threw her panties back at her, but missed and they flew across the room. 

She straddled up to him and replied, "You worry about your own pacing," and then slid down on him. For a moment his consciousness made him feel like he'd been hit by a brick. Then she began to slide, and instinct took over. If before there had been a struggle, it had only been a prelude to this. The full weight of his hips tried to buck her off while he grabbed her by the waist to keep her steady. She grabbed Creed's hands to steady herself, but as this dance proceeded she found she didn't need to. She let go and felt an electricifying rhythmic weightlessness. 

This was a time when she was tempted to wake the neighbors. She contented herself to let out muffled screams into her left hand whilst pleasuring her clit with her right. She felt like some hideous monster was trying to overwhelm her, and all she wanted to do was let go. She felt a frenzied combination of thrusting, spasming, thrusting, some wet streams, a grunt from Creed, and her heart beating so fast she was certain she'd pass out. But Creed stopped thrusting. He was rescinding. Electra let him pull out and then continued straddled his stomach, and rubbing her clit until her own climax a minute later. 

"Wow," Creed said. "I've never felt so obliterated."

"Yeah," she cooed, "I haven't had it this good since Cora's father... shit, I shouldn't have said that."

Creed wasn't in a mental state to be offended. "Yeah. But should I have dropped you? Should you have bit me?"

"Weird night." 

"Besides, I got the impression that he was out of the picture. Like, dead out of the picture."

"He was disappeared. He could be alive. But I've given up on seeing him again. Let's not dwell on the past."

"You got it. Mind if I get something to drink?"

"There may still be some good pomegrenate juice in the kitchen."

"Ah... a favorite. A bit of a rarity in the states. Well the Midwest anyway."

Creed disappear, and returned with a small glass, which he seemed to down all at once.

"Careful," Electra warned. "You might choke."

"I wouldn't bet on it. Well, I feel invincible. I mean," he took his place back on the wodden floor after grabbing two pillows off the sofa, "It's never been like this before. I didn't know I could... I'm all twisted for words. I don't understand."

"There's nothing to understand. It's sex. A variation of a dance started hundred of millions of years ago, and engraved into our very existence. Sometimes the human brain just makes it more complicated. It doesn't quite just bubble to the surface like the scent of an animal in heat. But you coax it in the right way."

"And you know all the steps. It's just there."

"Befpre we're born, I think. Certainly well before puberty."

"You sound very convinced."

"If you have any honesty and power of observation, you notice the effects of your parents. Huh..." she sighed. "Daddy's girl."

"Oh?"

"Don't bring this up when I'm not launching into a post-coital confession." 

"Done."

"My father went to an American university to study cryptography. Until a trip back to Greece to see family ended up with him meeting my mother. She died before I was too young to remember, and my dad took a lot of military contract jobs, setting up secure communications. He was paid well, in part to keep him from being contracted by someone else. The only person he thought he could trust was me. From a very early age I received a great deal of attention and approval. More than I think healthy for a child. He taught me English, and cryptography. He built me from the ground up to be his companion. I was programming at 11."

"Huh, they you talk about him, I'm surprised not six."

"You think he'd have carried a PC. But we moved unpredictably, and he worried about it getting lost in the shuffle. Laptops were available too, but even easier to lose. But he was a VIP. Access to a Unix Mainframe wasn't difficult. I got to program when the adminstrators were convinced I wouldn't run around and end up breaking anything. He kept me away good and tight. Frustrated by his employers, scared by the government, unable to talk about his passion, he needed me. But he was choking me. But those terminals... you could send mail through them. Depending on the system you might get out to the fledgling internet, though sometimes it was just university or miliatry employees. So in fact I had many friends. Friends I'd never met in person, but who I could talk to. It frightened me to death to talk about my personal problems. So it was always technical problems. Father was pleased with my progress. I was still so young, still able to ask that combination of tough and innocent questions possible of a child. Sometimes I'd ask something that stumped him that he had to riddle out for a few days. Then he'd come and reward me with whatever I wanted. Money was no obstacle. But I wanted friends. You can't buy those."

"You can imagine the friction that happened when my teenage self wanted some independence. So here am I know, defensive of my independence while craving the approval of a male power figure." She shook her head. "I understand arousal. I don't understand why the act is a truth serum."

"I'm sure it has it's reasons."

"Well then, let me hear about your parents."

"My parents?"

"Yeah, you're not an orphan."

"I don't talk about them often. I don't think about them often. A controlling father, jealous of his older brother's success in academia, disgusted by his brother's 'libertine' attitudes."

"What's libertine mean exactly?"

"Oh, he maintained an affair with a student, after she graduated mind you. Never married. Sired two kids by her, paid her way through four more years of college and motherhood, when she really needed the money. Then went back to his work. He wasn't a deadbeat dad, and I think they were on and off again for a number of years. But he didn't have a family you see. Maybe he thought he'd do more harm than good, so he just never bothered. I think the arrangement was a workable one. But it wasn't "how things were done." My father was a big believer in that kind of thing. My brother thought it was scandalous, and worked hard to keep me away from him. But he couldn't get away with not inviting him to family functions. Better for him to be hateful and awkward in silence then flame famliy drama. I didn't see my uncle much, but he gave me a nice watering on my intellectual seeds. So when I wanted to be a scholar, dad wasn't to thrilled about it. Everything he'd been working to avoid. You know that goes."

"I know how that goes."

"So this truth serum." Creed engaged her, "instinct or side effect?"

"Instinct."

"Clutching for trust, no matter how much you've keep something hidden in the past before?"

"Maybe. Yes, that very well may be it. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to sleep on my bed. Sofa's right there."
