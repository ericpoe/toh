Synopsis: A pair of scientists work on genetically engineering plants that can absorb / metabolize heavy metals. One, Mark, quits the project over ethical concerns with the project's success while the other, Margot stays on. The project is comandeered by the military, against Margot's will. Trapped and cornered, Margot kills the military man overseeing the project, General Dobson

"Whiskey sour, please," requested a small blonde woman, her hair back tightly, a few locks spilling onto her lab coat. She had no shot glass in front her. The gatherer around a man crying into his sleeve.

"Mark, I..." Margot pleaded as Mark continued to cry. "Why don't you bring this up with your wife. I... I'm no good at this sort of thing.

"I don't want comfort," Mark replied, trying to squelch back the rest of his tears. "My wife can't help but try and comfort me. It's not in her nature to let me despair."

"I don't want you to despair Mark."

"Yes but... she's dead Margot. Dead."

"I know. I know the story. Not well, mind you, you know, things you've said at work."

"If only I'd taken her to the zoo and not the jungle. That jungle. Why not the Amazon? Why not India? Why Southeast Asia?"

"You didn't know combat was there. The war was decades ago. Look you can blame the birthday idea, you can blame the location, you can blame the date. Hell, you can blame that you ate cheerios and missed the tour bus."

"I do. All of it. It was me."

"Or you can blame the person that planted the land mine, decades ago. That person wanted to kill and didn't really care who. That it should kill a little girl from outside the country without helping the war effort at all--it's what a land mine does. All this talk about it being your fault is really just blaming the victim.

"I know," Mark downed his whiskey sour, soon as it got to the table.

"Let you know if we need another one," Margot told the waiter.

"But reason has nothing to do with it. I can just feel her absence in my heart. There's something in me that's convinced I ought to have her smile back, her energy back, and nothing can sate it but an acknowledgement that it's there."

"Well... umm. It's there. You know I'm no good at this. Telling people what they should do."

"I know. You haven't even taken your lab coat off."

"Oh. Umm, I guess I should do that." Margot took off her coat and place it in her lap, but the formal hunter green blouse and matching long skirt didn't do much to make her look less formal or less out of place in the aging, cigarette stained bar, chosen mostly for the likelihood it would be empty.

Mark laughed.

"What?" Margot asked.

"Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. You could look coldly formal in a bikini." Mark smirked.

Margot smiled. "So why bother to look any other way?" 

"Keeps you single," Mark observed.

"Ha! Like I've met oodles and oodles of men really worth the effort?"

"Ok, but still, you might consider giving your heart out to someone," Mark said in more earnestness.

"That's what catalogues are for. My first love will always be my work. Our work. But since you don't want to be comforted, I guess now would be a bad time to discuss lab results."

"Oh?" Mark perked up.

"Lot number 37. Soil samples indicate a copper reduction of 19%. Finding is statistically signficant." Margot repated the report verbatim.

"That's great."

"Of course, our plant modifications only remove copper from the soil. They won't disarm unexploded land mines. So if you want to keep..."

"No," Mark interrupted, "I don't think I can maintain a day of mourning with such good news. My despair is not so profound. I wonder how long it will take to get a good batch going?"

"I'm not sure. I think we'll have to repeat the experiment a few times to get started. Then there's genome sequencing to be done. That ought to keep you on long enough for tenure. Maybe me too, if the publication gets big enough," Margot added hopefully.

-------------------------------------

A follow up on the copper hungry plants continued. Mark, Margot, and team considered the experiments promising, and a paper written on the experiments worked its way into publication. A follow up publication, however, discussing the nature and properties proved to be of great difficulty. It seemed the plants' nature changed based on the experiment.

The copper never seemed absorbed in quite the same way. Sometimes a bright shimmer deposited itself on the plant's leaves, making them droop and sometimes, after prolonged human contact, shoot sparks. The sparks themselves could never be measured, because no one seemed to have the equipment handy during the few moments it happened. Cameras were installed to record the phenomena, but seemed to frequently hiss static around the same time as the sparks. Nothing seemed to be able to be recorded.

It was known that some plants, some, responded dramatically to light in the blue to ultra-violet spectrum. Bathing a plant in such a light, however, had the effect of causing the stem to shoot upwards so quickly as to choke the leaves and die. Extracting DNA proved difficult, and whispers floated about that the DNA was changing during attempts to extract it. Some samples offered promising genes, other samples showed identical genes to those poisoned by the copper layered soils.

These finding were greatly complicated when mercury laden soils were provided to the labs by mistake, and some plants adapted to them. Experiments were simplified to show that it was indeed the plants swallowing up the mercury. But after this firm conclusion was reached, the plant's rapid oddness reasserted itself again. The same occurred with iron ridden soils.

Unable to grasp at the plants behavior scientifically, a collection of superstitions arose about the plants. Superstititions it was agreed should not infect the scientific process, but seemed to calm the nerves of many members on the team. "Never measure liquids in round flasks. Always use angular beakers." "If you bathe a plant in blue light, turn the light switch on an off as quick as you can in five minute intervals." Not every scientist heeded this advice. The procedures were followed to the whim of each member of the team.

But the effect of posting these rules seemed immediate. Three weeks later a reliable DNA sample was identified, with several important genes modified, but only several. They all had to do with transportation of solutes to different areas of the plant--exactly as they should expect. The findings were reported, the potpourri of folded leaves, shimmering stems, and a bitter after taste in the air were neglected in the report. If anyone replicated **their** results, well, they'd be a bit more forthcoming. It seemed though, that if anyone hoped to clean toxic metal soils, they'd have to learn how to farm the plants.

-----------------------------------------------

Mark looked up at his finished grant proposal. Whilst his team had found so many inconsistencies of its new metallic jungle, there was enough to go on to ask for funds. Reports of strange plant behavior did not leak far outside Mark's team, however. Some refused to believe in the plants seeming disregard for scientific principles, others had tried to point out the behavior to strangers, only to notice that every stranger with some authority opened the door to a lab filled with sickly plants that recovered a few days after that authority's absence.

It was 10:15pm, Mark had lost track of time again. He would likely be arriving an hour after his wife's bedtime. She had grown suspicious of Margot, who it seemed was at the lab every night, often to 2 or 3 am. Being suspicious about Margot he knew was completely ridiculous. You had to get two shots down her before she would even consider a date. But then, his wife's jealousy seemed a little off kilter. She ignored when his eyes lingered a little too long on a young waitress, but disliked his unattractive female colleagues.

A sort of intimacy had developed between himself and Margot. When you could feel someone else's mind working on the exact same problem, seeing the same phenomena, working through the same puzzles, it was impossible to feel alone. Maybe she was jealous of that. But if that were her concern, it shouldn't trouble her much longer. A noteworthy publication would mean a larger team and a less intimate lab. He and Margot might get split duties and not see much of each other. The late nights might be cut short due to extra staff. There was just one more night of potential couch sleeping, Mark was sure of it. He shuffled his papers to their proper slots and informed Margot he was leaving. She barely looked up.

Within a few weeks the university's change in plans was announced. It did involve more laboratory staff, a larger share of the budget as anticipated, but there were also two nasty surprises. A considerable grant had been offered to the project by the military, and the university insisted the discovered genes be patented.

Mark sought out Margot when she was alone. He was project leader, but she, having put in so many hours, had become a sort of silent partner. Someone whose mind was on the same goal, thinking the same things.

"We can't get caught up in military research," Mark insisted.

"It's not military research." Margot responded. "It's a one time grant. For research that will make it into public journals."

"I know that's what it looks like. What it means is we get a budget that we'll have to cut three years down the line if things don't pan out."

"But that's what any grant is like," Margot objected. "I know you don't see eye-to-eye with the military. But what possible weapon could they make from our project?"

"And the patent?" Mark insisted.

"I'm sure they're just worried someone will patent the genes and take the glory for themselves. Just takes a bit of risk out of the investment."

"And puts the dollars into the university budget. I thought we were going to make whatever seed came out of this publicly distributable. So farmers on marginal land could still afford it."

"I don't think that's what the university has in mind for our project, Mark. To lord over the seeds."

"Well you seem all fine and dandy. Since when have you become an apologist for the corruption of science?"

Margot looked over at Mark and said nothing. She looked genuinely hurt. "I thought all about it last night, after you went home."

"I'm sorry."

"It does have a funny smell to it I know. It does, contrary to your persuasion, seem to me to be a slight corruption of scientifc inquiry. But our little project, well it's not so little. There are other players now, and they don't think about science like you or I do."

"Doesn't that frighten you, Margot?"

"A little. I'm sure they see money, power, glory even in our project. A great discovery confers all three. I have thought about it. Mark, I think if we want to continue our academic inquiry, we have to pay to play, so to speak."

"No. No. Absolutely not. Money, power, glory, listen to yourself!" Mark shouted.

"You are... taking it worse than I thought you would. It's like we're at the bar, that day of mourning you had."

"It's very much like that bar," Mark agreed.

"You wanted, as I recall, to feel your despair uncomforted," Margot reminded.

"That's what I said. But I don't think, that I could have explained what I wanted to explain at the time."

"Now would be a fine time if you can express it now."

"Every step I've taken in life is now linked to my daughter's death. I had another boy, you know. He owes his life to my mistake. I changed my subject of study, that's part of it too."

"So does any point in our past affect us. Your despair defines that moment as pivotal."

"You don't understand. I **can't** profit from my daughter's death."

"You let that moment control too much of your life. I have, you know, had two or three years to toss around what you said to me in my head. You didn't expect me not to think about it did you?"

"Well, I guess I shouldn't have." Mark admitted.

"You want it to be someone's fault. You could lay the blame on yourself, as I'm sure you've tried. But you know you couldn't have guessed. So all you have is some nameless soldier. It's his fault this happened, but you'll never meet him. He never intended it to be you. What you can't get over is that it was an accident."

"You're right Margot. It was an accident. But I'm not having these experiments turn into another accident. The warning signs are all there."

"I think you've blown them out of proportion, Mark."

"Well I don't care what proportion they're in or not. If the military stays, I resign. If the patent stays, I resign. You can put your name on the work Margot. You've earned it."

-----------------------------------------------

Mark groggily answered his cell phone at 1:17 am. It was Margot. He could not remember the last time they had talked.

"Margot?" he said in confusion, then wondered about disturbing his wife. He walked down to the kitchen in his pajamas.

"I need to speak with you. It's a matter of life and death," Margot's voice was shrill and pleading.

"What? What are you talking about? What's going on? Why haven't you called the police?"

"They can't help me... I need a place to hide Mark."

"You thinking of coming here? I'm in Omaha. I should imagine that a bit of a stretch."

"I don't care. I'm coming tonight. I'm packed and ready. All I need is your say so," Margot bit her lip.

"If it's that urgent..." he began, but the send of a car engine cut him off.

"I'll call you back later." As suddenly as it started, it stopped. Mark wasn't even quite sure Margot really had plans to visit. But whatever it was in her voice, the wife wasn't going to like it. He sat down to eat some corn flakes alone, but he was joined by his wife and not really given time to sugar coat anything.

"Who was that? You sounded quite scared, honey."

"It was Margot. I don't exactly know how to say this, but she sounded like she needed a place to stay. Our place."

"She has her own money I should hope?" Mark's wife asked. It was not the first objection he expected from her. "From the university you quit? Our budget's stretched tight as it is."

"I think... she may have some cash with her, but I can't help but wonder if she's out of a job. But she's a teacher. There's work for her somewhere."

"As long as you two don't get caught up in any experiments."

Mark looked at the determined finger pointing at him. "Those days are behind me."

"Good. I went to bed lonely a lot of nights because of her, Mark."

"Because of my work."

"Because of her. You two just get caught up in your biology... I know. I know. Mouse you call her. Couldn't attract a drunkard. But she was stealing your heart from me."

"No she wasn't! Well, maybe a little. We did have that weird mind meld thing happen sometimes. But the experiment's over."

"Not for her I'm guessing. No funny business with you mister. I'll be watching."

Mark ate his corn flakes but couldn't sleep. Margot sounded more like she was fleeing domestic violence than anything that would have arisen in her job. Another phone call came in about an hour later. Mark could hear road noise.

"I'm sorry to wake you again," she apologized.

"I never fell back to sleep," Mark reassured.

"I just need to make sure everything stayed... private."

"What are you running from?" Mark asked.

"Well, you said getting military funding was a bad idea. You were right. I just need someone to talk to about the... experiment. I signed an NDA, so I needed to talk to someone, you know, a little covert."

"Well, don't say anything you might regret."

"That's why I need to talk to you in person. I've got a decision to make and realized I could disappear for a weekend."

"So it's just the weekend? That'll ease the concerns of the wife," Mark sighed in relief.

"She still jealous?"

"I promised my heart to her. She can't have some nerdy girl seduce my brain."

"Is that why she never liked me? Well, I have a lot of science to talk about. Didn't know if I could cram it into a weekend. But if I must," Margot added, "I'll try."

"So what happened when I stormed out? I know there were some papers, but I didn't read them."

"You really dropped your interest that much, Mark?"

"I stopped talking to the experimenters remember? Hell, I left the university system. I had interest, especially in the early days, but no access."

"Well, you'll remember how hard it was to keep those metal siphoning plants under control. The soil wasn't enigmatic and we could measure that. But the odd crystalline structures, the metals never ending up in the same places, the incosistency of their growth patterns..."

"We got a handle on that, as I recall," Mark interrupted.

"Yes, well, I mean you know what happened. The gene sequences were so inconsistent that we just took several samples from the same specimens. Oh, our results got replicated. But no one ever reported, that lack of control."

"Until the memo went up," Mark reminded.

"Right! The memo. A scattering of superstitions that half of us ignored... I have been thinking, for a long time, that we were looking at a quantum phenomena. That's the only hard science were physics changes as a result of the observer. Like the rules of plant science were bending just for us. Weird," Margot shivered at the memory.

"It was."

"Well, we continued our work. There was some talk of trying to bottle this stuff. I mean grow it in cultures, engineer plants. Then we designed an experiment as a favor to our underwriters. The military didn't seem as interested in the metals we were working with.

"They were a lot more interested in plants that could absorb uranium. Not the fissile kind. The depleted kind, the kind they use to make those bunker buster bombs. Couldn't clean out battlefield toxicity without it, and they kind of had a point."

"So what happened. Did you find plants that worked like that?" Mark asked eagerly.

"Well yes. But something happened."

"What?" Mark asked.

"This guy Dobson showed up, and well, all that chaos?"

"Yeah?"

"It disappeared. The plants went back to being, well, plants. They had odd colorations or minor structural problems, but normal. I think the man scared the plants. I mean silly as that sounds Mark."

"He bad news?"

"Definitely. Classified the project, made me sign an NDA."

"Then why?"

"Well, I haven't really told you about anything after the NDA. This is just what you would have learned if you'd stayed in contact." There was a mild chiding in Margot's voice.

"But you need to say more?"

"Yes. In person."

"Well, I suppose we could meet at the Lonestar BBQ. I um, don't think the Omaha-Texas crossover BBQ tradition is going to attract to much attention. I don't think you have to worry about me and your NDA either."

"I'm a vegan."

"So no one will think to look for you there. I'm sure you'll find something."

----------------------------------

The Lonestar BBQ was not much to look at--the fancy of two aspiring entrepeneurs that thought an Omaha strip mall was going to be the capital of a new BBQ tradition. The Kansas City tradition was closer and more what Mark would have expected customers to want. Its mostly empty chairs on a Saturday morning seemed to speak to his suspicions. The whole damn place looked like a make shift party room with cheap furniture rentals for tables.

Margot showed up alone, though Mark looked over her shoulder for some time. He yawned, watered himself with a little coffee and said, "So what's so damn important?"

"It's the project. Remember I talked about the uranium plants?"

"Yes. That was quite the twist. Implied they did something sinister. They find weapons of mass destruction?" Mark half joked.

"We were a bit, naive, when we decided to try seeping up metal from battlefields," Margot informed.

"What do you mean?"

"The lasting environmental impact of a battlezone. We wanted to get rid of it. Wanted things to heal. But a battlefield does something. It doesn't do it well or straight-forwardly. But it, shows, really shows, the devastation of war. It creates a record, blossoms a memory that doesn't forget. Without that memory..." Margot paused for effect, "the field is ready for another battle,"

"You mean the plants white wash the evidence?" Jason asked incredulously.

"Not really of course. You find uranium consuming plants, you'll find uranium shells just waiting in the soil. But the plants look like flourishing and recovery. That's what they were interested in. You guessed it, Mark. Not what happened, but the underlying principle."

"So, what are you going to do?"

"Well, I can't quit the project. It's part of the agreement."

"Are you stuck then Margot? What do you intend to do?"

"I need your opinion on this Dobson guy. All that expectation around the office? I don't know what happened but he killed it. The plants seemed to respond immediately."

"You know I never really worked it out why those plants behaved so... unreally. What's the deal with this Dobson guy?"

"I just. He scares me." I took some time for Margot to continue. "Back in that bar all those years ago. You were trying to talk about a sorrow you couldn't reason with? Well, he's a fear I can't seem to reason with. His mind is... well, there's no invention you could fathom that he couldn't turn into a weapon. I think our pollution preventation project of ours is just a drop in the bucket. He's ruthless, and I'm terrified of what's behind him. The kind of project he's working for. So I've just sort of done my job, knowing that no matter what fascination science has for me, it will become a weapon to handle someone else."

"Get out then." Mark advised.

"I can't get out like you though. It's not that easy. I'm stuck in the contract."

'Ha! Easy, you call my getting out easy? Going from hotshot experimentor to high school science teacher with a wife and two boys?"

"Of course I didn't mean to..."

"I know you didn't mean anything by it, Margot. What I'm saying to you is, it's dealing with the unknown that's the huge obstacle. Once I settled in Omaha well, I've eked out a normal life for my family."

"Yeah..." Margot looked hopeful. "I'll get out. Never say a word to anybody. Why would they bother themselves too much if I disappeared and just didn't say anything?"

-----------------------------------------

"Margot, Margot. I've been looking for you," Dobson chided. He looked down on her, sopping wet and trying to change a tire in the dark. "Country roads can be so dangerous in this kind of rain."

"I'm not going back to work. You can find someone else to be your stooge Dobson."

"You've been with the project since the beginning. You're a valuable asset." Dobson's voice was smooth and confident. I suggest safety and security for an unresisted return."

"Valuable to you, you mean," Margot fired back.

"I don't think you've really appreciated the importance of your work. Come, let's get out of the rain."

"I know the value of what was my work. That's why I ran." Margot looked up from the tire defiantly. 

"You and your friend envisioned a world where the stains of war would be washed away--eaten by plants. You envisioned an end of undetonated explosives in fields no longer at war. So simple, and so limited. Why wouldn't it be preferable to wipe the record of the battle from existence?" Dobson asked.

"But you don't intend on wiping battles clean at all."

"But I do. America remains the most prosperous nation on earth, and does half its military spending. I know the correlation is far more direct than our citizens believe it to be. There are little battefields everywhere on earth. Special forces, intelligence plots, the list swells. But awareness of these battles is dim indeed.

"War has always had two components. The soldiers on the field and the soldiers at home. The soldiers at home have grown so very picky. They are swayed by arguments about justice and civilian casualties. But war is needed to ensure prosperity."

"Spare me the sermon, Dobson."

"No sermon. Explanation. If there were simply no record of the war at all, well, imagine how much money that would save conducting it," Dobson sounded like he were pitching the idea to brass.

"And I'm sure the taxpayer would rejoice at the windfall," Margot sneered.

"You just don't see the beauty of a nation with no historical memory," Dobson sighed. "But don't worry. I do, and so long as you keep working for me, I suppose that will do."

"I guess I can't run anymore," Margot sighed, and picked herself and her tire iron out of the mud.

"No you can't," replied Dobson, "Get in my car," he beckoned with his gun and turned to his vehicle. Perhaps it was the rain, perhaps it was overconfidence, but he hadn't noticed that Margot hadn't dropped the tire iron she was clutching. Within seconds of her no longer in his line of sight, he was struck hard on his right shoulder. The blow sent him sprawling and he dropped his gun. He struggled to get to his feet but then a blow landed on the back of his right leg. He swivelled away trying to get outside the reach of the tire iron, with the result that he was struck hard on the left leg. Metal crunching bone left a sickening echo in the air.

He could see Margot, barely, in the light cast by his car's headlights. Dripping with mud and holding the tire iron with both hands above her head in striking mode, she did not look like one that had earned the nickname Mouse.

"Margot, what are you doing?" Dobson pleaded in shock. His limbs were in no condition to attempt an escape.

"Some things have to be taken by force, general. You taught me that."

"What do you want? Whatever it is you want, I can get it."

"I want my soul back," Margot declared.

"You don't have to continue with your work."

Another blow came crashing down on his ribs before he could help it. He gasped for air.

"Not my work. My soul. I saw a world that needn't stay poisoned after war had left it. You took the light of my discoveries and turned them into a blindfold. You saw in it only a way the killing could continue. A way that war could be hidden. A way that the horrors of war would forever remain only in the hearts of those that lived and died."

"But what about your own horror?"

"If I must carry a burden of horror, let it be this. Let it be this." Margot's pitch did not falter. 

"How do you get your soul back from this?" Dobson pleaded.

"I will get my soul back when you die, knowing that you are a coward."

"What?"

"A coward. A coward. A coward. Hiding behind guns, money, institutions, the death of braver men, halfway around a planet."

"Ok. Ok, I understand. You don't need my death. We can make a deal," Dobson offered.

"Men like you don't make deals," Margot sneered again. A chill went through Dobson's heart. He knew, if it were him, he would never leave someone in his position alive. But he was certain Margot's heart was different, that it did not have the conviction to end someone.

"Margot, you're not..." Dobson pleaded, but the blow came just the same. Dobson's head ground itself into the mud, then bobbed gently.
