"It's two days earlier this time," Margot stated flatly.

"You're curious," Mark replied, fidgeting with some bread roolls provided as appetizers.

"I am." I know this time of year is hard on you."

"It is, and things are different this year."

"Not so different. This is the third year in a row you've taken me to this tiny Italian restaurant to mourn your daughter. Me. Not your wife."

"IO can't talk to my wife. She doesn't understand."

"I should think she would understand more than me. She lost a daughter too. Maybe she understand only too well?"

"You think you don't get it. You're single. You don't have any kinds. But you're a greater comfort than you realize."

"You're somber. You have a lost. I don't understand you half the time on these get yearly get togethers. I guess I just let you be. So be. What's on your mind this year?"

"That's just it. You let me be. There's no, "It's not your fault', 'you couldn't have known', or 'don't be so hard on yourself'. I don't want to feel happy on the eve of my daughter's death. I want to feel miserable. And you... you want to see things as they are. Maybe it's the science background. Maybe it's a curiosity that lead you into science in the first place. Have I trailed off a bit? This year is going to be especially hard. That's why I desired to meet with your early. I've finished the numbers on our experiment."

"Are they what we hoped?"

"P-value .017. Statistical significance. The experiment found something."

"That's wonderful! I hope... I guess you'll have to work hard to stay miserable this time around."

"Yes."

"Stay away from alcohol. You might do something you regret."

"So speaks a woman of experience on these matters?"

"That's none of your business." The words came out shriller than Margot expected. She let out a nervous chuckle to smooth the tension and hoped Mark was too caught up in his sorrow to notice.

"Let's look at the facts. My late daughter wanted to see the jungle. The jungles of Southeast Asia and not free of land mines. I tried to bury myself in my work. Analysis of uptake of metallic pollution in the soil by certain plant species. This was of obvious symbolic signficance, an attempt to make amends. And we did it. The plants we engineered remove metal from the soil, and in the four intervening years my wife bore me a darling baby girl, and I want to be miserable." Mark pounded on the table for emphasis, nearly knocking over Margot's wine glass.

"And share your misery with someone who's not going to tell you to look on the bright side?"

"Yes."

"Because, in my estimation the actions you took in response to your daugters death... if those are rewarded it implies your benefited from the tragedy."

"Pretty much."

"And if I were to speculate this is indeed the case. Your current benefits did come about because of the tragedy. But things needn't have happened this way. Some other scientist could have done this work. Some years done the line you and your wife might have had another child even without one passing away. She didn't need to die for anything."

"And the loss of a child... there's just a need. You're a biologist. You understand the strength of animal need."

"Yes," Margot responded, averting Mark's gaze. She was certain the remark was pure brooding without innuendo. But Margot couldn't help but think of the matter.

"Something wrong?"

"I need a moment to think."

"Our roles are to reverse?"

"Briefly." Margot replied. She tried to squelch her unwanted desires. Mark was an unyielding sort of man, in his own personal way, and that excited her. The reasons for her excitement--the desire to yield--was even more troubling to her than her fantasies about a married man. A distance past of high school dating had been with dumb hungry animals that demanded. Mark was different somehow. She could never put her finger on a specific thing, but there was an allure, an allure hopefully Mark would never discover and was not to be acted upon.

Better to do what she'd done ofr a long time: stay single and focus on her career. Embrace her nickname, "Mousy Margot" for as long as things in her life didn't change. Enjoy the company of friends.

"You've been a great colleague Mark."

"Thank you."

"We've done important work. We can't expect to burn and bury our garbage away. Copper is a poisonous in sufficient quantity. It may not solve everything, but it's a contribution, and I'm glad to have done it with you."

"Thanks. Though the condition of our meeting was that I was to be miserable. If I can't manage it though, I suppose I can make an exception this year."

"So what are your plans for the future?"

"We have to get this study fit for publication. We'll have to delve into all the specifics of a limited subset of species whilst hoping to see parallel developments in the field. We can read those vicarously."

"And if we see a variety of species capable of metabolizing industries many pollutants?"

"I'll find the city dump and plant a garden."

--------------------------------------------------------

"Here we are," Margot declared, "back in your little restaurant."

"More wine," Mark said to the waiter.

"You were saying something about incremental knowledge. Working towards a greater goal?"

"That was eight months ago."

"Has so much time passed?"

"Ugh." Mark gulped down of what remained of the first wine bottle.

"I'll take that to mean yes."

"I can't understand it."

"I'm just as baffled."

"Organic life is filled with... with enzymes, proteins, genes, complex biological processes that are very specific. They don't just..."

"They don't just eat metal."

"This isn't science. It's alchemy. The plants are absorbing the metallic properties of the soil."

"I just, there's got to be another explanation."

"What explanation? Copper is not plant food. Neither is iron. Neither is mercury."

"Neither is uranium."

"Hmph. I bet if we tested that, this plants would eat it too."

"Well, we're going to find out soon."

"Since when did we get access to that?"

"The grant proposal went through. You didn't get that email?"

"We've been swamped. I can't remember the last time I checked it."

"I found out about it three days ago."

"Why didn't you mention it?"

"We've been swamped. I've been reading up on it. It's Uranium 238, the kind that doesn't... fission. Is that a word?"

"Try split."

"Ok, it's the Uranium atoms they don't split. It's alpha radiation, so we'll just need a little bit of protective gear. It should be safe."

"How? How would the lab have access to that kind of thing? Some government agency had to have signed off on it. And I've never known bureaucrats to clear something so quickly. Some high up the ladder looked over our research. The Department of Energy maybe?"

"The military."

"No."

"They use depleted uranium in artillery shells. I could see why they'd want to see if it could be removed from the soil. At least, that's were the uranium is coming from. Military surplus."

"Absolutely not."

"Mark..." I know they don't think highly of the military.

"They killed my daughter!"

"Those were different people, in a different time."

"No. They're the same people, in the same time. Not the same physical people. But people with the same thoughts in their heads as killed my daughter."

"Mark. I think you're overstating your case."

"No. People are their thoughts. Same thoughts, same people."

"I don't disagree with how you feel."

"But you want me to change my mind?"

"I don't... maybe we've both had a little too much wine. Maybe we both aren't thinking clearly."

"I can see what this is, drunk or sober."

"Then what is it?"

"They think we have a weapon."

"We might, but it's not so simple. It's toxic metals, removed from the soil. The army used those shells in Iraq. If we could remove the traces... it would be just like you always wanted. Erasing the remnants of war. You want that don't you?"

"Of course I do. But the money will be coming from them."

"The university gets funding from a lot of sources."

"Not like theirs. Their pockets don't have bottoms. They have room for as much as you can imagine, and they wouldn't be unhappy to have a brand new lab."

"Mark, you're being unreasonable."

"I am not. They control the purse strings, they control where the resource goes. You know as well as I that the plants absorbing the metals can't be released into the wild. They'll kill anything that eats them until we understand the chemical process."

"Mark, keep your voice down." Margot implored, grabbing him by the wrist. It was a sudden move, and she thought to comfort. She thought to restrain. But the touch electrified her. They were drunk. A night of indiscretion might be forgiven...

"Margot, what's wrong?"

"I think I'm going to be sick."

"I didn't mean to. Maybe I am a little... I don't expect my attitude to change when I sober up. But I guess I have been... I didn't mean to yell at you. I'm not angry at you."

"I..." she averted her gaze. "I kind of like seeing you angry."

"You do?"

"It shows your dedication. Your commitment to your values."

"Oh. Well, for what it's worth Margot, I don't think it would necessarily be bad, if you went ahead with the project. It's just, well, it goes against me principles. You understand principles, don't you?"

"I understand the idea. What do you mean by it?"

"A principle is something that you don't go against, no matter how reasonable it may seem. A principle is something you hold in your core, and the ration and reason in the world can't get it out. Maybe that's unscientific. But then again, I'm not on the clock. I'm not conducting an experiment. I'm talking about values. I will not assist the military."

"Even in doing an experiment you would do in their absence?"

"Yes."

"I hadn't anticipated the strength of your reaction. I think the work we've done is important. The kind of thing they immemorialize in a textbook. You're my co-author, but don't be surprised if I continue on without you."

"You know I can't just let this happen."

"No, you can't. That means resignation, doesn't it?"

"It does."

"Well... it's likely we can't get the uranium from anywhere else. But... you've been important to the university. If you were to resign over the funding. If you were to insist that it be purchased from the military but without any funding from the Department of Defence."

"I might be able to stomach that Margot. If it were a one time purchase, the money might not have as much leverage as I fear. But... you've got to keep that compromise a secret. If that's the compromise I'm going to get, I'm going to have to demand more."

"Ah. Politics. I was never any good at it."

"It wouldn't surprise you to know I've done a little war protesting."

"It's hard to imagine you wouldn't."

"It can't be my private martyrdom. The school will have to feel some heat. Student organizing, protests, rallies, editorials. Hell, get some students to yammer on social media. Facebook and Twitter and that sort of thing. The students will know how to use those tools. So..."

"Yes Mark?"

"Can you play the good cop to my bad cop? Can you defend me to the insiders, who won't take kindly to me from the sheer negative publicity?"

"I think I can. I do know... I do know the money can compromise the experiment. I think maybe the university values its independence and commitment to inquiry more than you're giving them credit for. So putting up a fight, I don't think the idea doesn't have value. I don't think it needs to be here, and now, on this issue. But I want you to do it."

"Good, because if you think things are stressful now, brace yourself. I'm going to raise hell."

Margot began to say, "I wouldn't have it any other way," but she paused. She still hadn't forgotten the touch, and how unwanted the excitement had been. She didn't trust herself not to thrown in a little sultriness to her tone when she made that statement.

---------------------------------------
**Note: Needs Beginning Scene**

"You were not naive," Margot responded, "You didn't want to work on a project that might be compormoised. Your leaving might leave them on their toes regarding integrity. I'm stayoing on. I'm a biologist. I can't walk away from this. I will miss you. But maybe you're leaving will mean..."

"Mean what?"

"That Mousey Margot can look to your example and stand up too, if she needs to."

"Mark let a deep breath surge through his nostrils, "I am leaving the place in capable hands." He paused. Marogt wondered if he was planning something. "I think it would be best if I never entered this room after tongith. But I think I should... Have something to remember this night."

Margot's heart started pounding. "Like what?" she said softly.

"Some that has nothing to do with science. "That that damn lab coat off. It doesn't suit the moment."

"What then?"

"I don't know, poetry maybe. Photography? I have a cell phpne. I'd sketch if I were any good at it. "Wait. Don't you darw? I thought you said you did."

"It's been a long time. I was never any good. Not really."

"But now's a good night for not really."

"Yeah. A good night for not really. I guess I can do that."

Scrap paper and pencils where not hard to find, but a proper angle for observation proved more challenging. What was to be emphasized? The plants or the spaces between them? They were separated from each other in precision fashion, with identical lighting applied to each. It was not conducive to a landscape.

Margot, having surveyed the square, proceeded a little to the left. She looked at the garden as a whole, and knew it was for the first time. Not something to measure and control. Only observe, and try to represent. She cocked her head curiously."

"What?" asked Mark.

"There's a gradient."

"A gradient?"

"Yes, a gradual transition of color. There's four groups of plants--coppoer, iron, mercury, and control. The control ivy is green. But the brownish tinge with a hint of green fom the copper leaves? Look how it just fades form plant to plant. If there was major coloration for each element, you'd expect discrete colors for each row of plants. It's like they're not absorbing the elements from the soil. It's like they're breathing them from the air."

"Breathing huh? I should wonder if maybe it's not an infection."

"Infection? That could certainly suggest a few experiments."

"Well, you might want to keep those private, considering the circumstances."
