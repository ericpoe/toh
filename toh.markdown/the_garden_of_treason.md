"It's two days earlier this time," Margot stated flatly.

"You're curious," Mark replied, fidgeting with some bread roolls provided as appetizers.

"I am." I know this time of year is hard on you."

"It is, and things are different this year."

"Not so different. This is the third year in a row you've taken me to this tiny Italian restaurant to mourn your daughter. Me. Not your wife."

"IO can't talk to my wife. She doesn't understand."

"I should think she would understand more than me. She lost a daughter too. Maybe she understand only too well?"

"You think you don't get it. You're single. You don't have any kinds. But you're a greater comfort than you realize."

"You're somber. You have a lost. I don't understand you half the time on these get yearly get togethers. I guess I just let you be. So be. What's on your mind this year?"

"That's just it. You let me be. There's no, "It's not your fault', 'you couldn't have known', or 'don't be so hard on yourself'. I don't want to feel happy on the eve of my daughter's death. I want to feel miserable. And you... you want to see things as they are. Maybe it's the science background. Maybe it's a curiosity that lead you into science in the first place. Have I trailed off a bit? This year is going to be especially hard. That's why I desired to meet with your early. I've finished the numbers on our experiment."

"Are they what we hoped?"

"P-value .017. Statistical significance. The experiment found something."

"That's wonderful! I hope... I guess you'll have to work hard to stay miserable this time around."

"Yes."

"Stay away from alcohol. You might do something you regret."

"So speaks a woman of experience on these matters?"

"That's none of your business." The words came out shriller than Margot expected. She let out a nervous chuckle to smooth the tension and hoped Mark was too caught up in his sorrow to notice.

"Let's look at the facts. My late daughter wanted to see the jungle. The jungles of Southeast Asia and not free of land mines. I tried to bury myself in my work. Analysis of uptake of metallic pollution in the soil by certain plant species. This was of obvious symbolic signficance, an attempt to make amends. And we did it. The plants we engineered remove metal from the soil, and in the four intervening years my wife bore me a darling baby girl, and I want to be miserable." Mark pounded on the table for emphasis, nearly knocking over Margot's wine glass.

"And share your misery with someone who's not going to tell you to look on the bright side?"

"Yes."

"Because, in my estimation the actions you took in response to your daugters death... if those are rewarded it implies your benefited from the tragedy."

"Pretty much."

"And if I were to speculate this is indeed the case. Your current benefits did come about because of the tragedy. But things needn't have happened this way. Some other scientist could have done this work. Some years done the line you and your wife might have had another child even without one passing away. She didn't need to die for anything."

"And the loss of a child... there's just a need. You're a biologist. You understand the strength of animal need."

"Yes," Margot responded, averting Mark's gaze. She was certain the remark was pure brooding without innuendo. But Margot couldn't help but think of the matter.

"Something wrong?"

"I need a moment to think."

"Our roles are to reverse?"

"Briefly." Margot replied. She tried to squelch her unwanted desires. Mark was an unyielding sort of man, in his own personal way, and that excited her. The reasons for her excitement--the desire to yield--was even more troubling to her than her fantasies about a married man. A distance past of high school dating had been with dumb hungry animals that demanded. Mark was different somehow. She could never put her finger on a specific thing, but there was an allure, an allure hopefully Mark would never discover and was not to be acted upon. 

Better to do what she'd done ofr a long time: stay single and focus on her career. Embrace her nickname, "Mousy Margot" for as long as things in her life didn't change. Enjoy the company of friends. 

"You've been a great colleague Mark."

"Thank you."

"We've done important work. We can't expect to burn and bury our garbage away. Copper is a poisonous in sufficient quantity. It may not solve everything, but it's a contribution, and I'm glad to have done it with you."

"Thanks. Though the condition of our meeting was that I was to be miserable. If I can't manage it though, I suppose I can make an exception this year." 

"So what are your plans for the future?"

"We have to get this study fit for publication. We'll have to delve into all the specifics of a limited subset of species whilst hoping to see parallel developments in the field. We can read those vicarously."

"And if we see a variety of species capable of metabolizing industries many pollutnats?"

"I'll find the city dump and plant a garden."
