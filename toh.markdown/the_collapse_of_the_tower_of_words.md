Status: Annotated::Staging
Synopsis: After the manowar incident, Creed, Electra, and Cora are apprehended by a Russian military squad and taken to a base somewhere about a ten hour drive for Greece, outside the border. Creed is stuck with merely waiting, and we don't see the other two characters. The Russian interrogator Anna seems to know Creed has been coming into contact with manifestations of HADES and the earthly branch of its Theatre, but wishes the full summary. She is gathering information as to whether Creed has seen to much and should be shot.

However, someone behind the Theatre of HADES, someone who sames to have an active and more knowledgeable role in Creed's adventure, relieves Anna of her duty before Creed dies of poisoning. He offers Creed a substance known as the Blood of Apollo, which will give him a vision offering a choice. He is offered the chance to martyr himself for an important lost scroll or to let historical distortion remain. He chooses the later. The man leaves, but his departure does not seem to indicate an end to his quest.

The crowd at the beach parted at the sight of military uniforms, halted only by a desire to avoid the mound of metal now trying to soak it's way into the sands. When Creed gave a glance the first time, he had only been looking for enough signals to indicate there was a military. He had expected a Greek unit armed mostly with crowd control weaponry. When he looked back, he saw both AK-47's and Cyrillic characters on the uniforms rather than Greek. They were Russian military uniforms, and sorely out of jurisdiction. This was a covert operations team, although how covert they were being at the moment seemed minuscule.

Creed lifted his hands above his head, and instructed Cora to do likewise. He would have gone willing, but a rifle butt clocked him in the temple and sent him sprawling. They duct taped his mouth and lead him away in handcuffs. His vision had been too blurry to see what was going on with Cora and Electra. After being dragged ten to twenty feet he was thrown into the back of trunk. It was tilted open slightly, hopefully for breathing. A few rays of light made their way in before being absorbed by the black trunk bed. Now there was nothing to do but wait.

He certainly needed time for reflection, time to get a grip. But trapped with nothing to do, his mind faltered instead. It strained with distracted boredom, as if the deprivation of his senses had deprived him of the rest of his faculties as well. He could tell only that, despite the feeling of moving on top of wheels, with all their swerves and bumps, nothing was changing. It was all still the same trunk, still the same car, still the same trap, with little reference to time, other than a few scattered rays.

Those slowly faded from view, and Creed hoped they would reach their destination before nightfall, so that he would at least have his clock. Everything else was gone, save for a pair of increasingly uncomfortable swimming trunks. His memory remained, though he wondered when that, too, would fail. He tried remembering a place he would rather be.

He first pictured his uncle's office. They had had a nice chat, Creed would work out some way to be back in the good graces of the schools administers and be given a different courses to teach. That memory didn't really work, because he didn't want to go back to his university. He tried other moments with Electra, but they all ended up here. He tried his study abroad days, only to begrudgingly feel he had taxed those good memories beyond what they could bear. He tried to envision earning his doctorate, only to know it lead to a mediocre post in academia. No memory lead to hope. The memories weren't necessarily bad, they just couldn't be called on to counter this, this being stuck in some mysterious vehicle, powerless to stop his fate.

Perhaps they had come to take him to the Theatre. He still had a ticket, back at Electra's place. The circumstances leading to that conclusion were certainly unusual, but not less than the Theatre itself, which remained as inexplicable as ever. More familiar perhaps, but still without explanation. No, this sort of treatment was left to those being imprisoned or interrogated, and neither was an exciting prospect. Imprisonment seemed to offer rot and neglect. Interrogation seemed to imply a possible escape, but also torture until he offered information. But what information could have really give? In spite of the fantastic things he had seen, they hadn't seemed to add up to some larger scheme. Perhaps that scheme would be better known by his interrogators. Perhaps there were answers, though to which questions he could not guess, mostly from a dull lack of focus from a massive headache.

It occurred to him to try the memory plunging again, then to try the speculation again, then to just keep repeating the cycle until he fell asleep. It wouldn't keep him particularly emotionally stable, but it would pass the time, which seemed more pressing at the moment. The hard earth under the wheels was unrelenting, now that it was the only thing he could really hear. But it did relent, to time.

Creed expected a blindfold when he was allowed to exit the trunk, but find only an unmarked and poorly painted garage from which little was to be seen. He did see other trucks, and though he wished Cora and Electra not to be here at all, he hoped they wouldn't remain separated. He admitted to himself that the military probably didn't have any interest in them remaining together. With their mutual fates in jeopardy, they would be easier to threaten, intimidate, or blackmail.

As Creed was moved in the company of several soldiers, little words were exchanged between them. He wondered if this was standard in the treatment of a prisoner or if the soldiers had lost their voices from disuse. In any case, the transferred him to an unmarked room after directing him down several unnecessary turns and oddly curved corridors.

The room was not filled with implements of torture. It appeared more like a patient's room at a doctor's office, only with medical equipment twenty years out of date. The room even had medical diagrams like a doctor's office, one showing a giant diagram of an eye, another of an ear. They were all in Russian, whose Greek based alphabet was nonetheless unreadable. No one at the doctor's office ever explained their choice of charts, nor did he expect his captors to. But dissecting the diagrams mentally gave him something to do, which was an extraordinary comfort. The room wasn't so bad.

He was soon greeted in the room by a woman named Anna, he was small, had a cheery voice and spoke fluent English.

"Good evening," Anna said, "might I trouble you for your name?"

"Creed. Jonathon Creed." He thought of lying, but then, he was a civilian. There were other parts of the story he planned to alter later on.

"Well then, Mr. Creed, why don't you tell me what you saw?"

"The bottom of a trunk," he answered testily, then grinned trying to pass it out as a joke. "Though it wasn't a particularly interesting trunk. I guess you're wondering about before the trunk."

"Yes," Anna's short answer did not betray amusement.

"A horde of manowar swarmed the beach. I stayed quite still. They must have been reacting to the sudden movements of the other beach goers."

"I've been informed multiple people tried your tactic. You and that woman were the only ones in the water to remain alive."

"Oh, well, maybe they were repelled by the sunscreen on my legs?"

"Sunscreen?" Anna eyed him, and he thought she was trying to ascertain if he was playing dumb.

"Well, that might have been it. They glowed all the colors of the rainbow, they felt like metal, and they collapsed into a metallic puddle. I mean, with all those bizarre characteristics, who says the answer can't be sunscreen?" Creed asked.

"You do have a point, but I find the explanation unsatisfying."

"Why unsatisfying?" Creed asked. He thought maybe he could flip the investigation.

"I'll be the one asking the questions, dear," she said lightly. "You're an American."

"A tourist, yes," Creed responded.

"Who were you with?"

"A woman named Electra. I'd just met her." Creed declared.

"Very brave to rescue a stranger's child the way you did, Mr. Creed."

"Thank you."

"Why were you so sure she needed rescuing?" Anna inquired.

"I didn't. I just imagined I might be able to take a sting where she wouldn't. I really lifted her out of the water before I had a clear view of what was happening."

"I also find this brave American tourist story of yours unsatisfying. I'm afraid if your answers don't become more satisfying I shall have to make some up, and not in your favor." Anna explained to  Creed where he stood.

"What?" Creed explained in shock. He struggled not to have his face betray his understanding that no positive answers could be given to the woman's questions. It was all just a question of sifting through which information could get him in the least amount of trouble.

"Of course that is not my intention. Turn your head a little, let me look at your injury."

Creed hesitated for a moment, afraid of being beaten again. She was a small woman, but armed with a truncheon he expected she could do some damage.

"Hmm... should be a dull ache by now I suspect. Why don't you tell me how you met this Electra."

"I was at a cafe, and she had a laptop, I wondered if I could check my email. We struck up a conversation."

"About what?" Anna asked.

"I had never been to this part of Greece, so I asked her what there was to do here. She brought up the sea and I thought it a fine time to go to the beach."

"Then where did you stay, for the night?" Anna asked, piercing Creed's narrative.

Creed sensed he was getting led into a lie of some sort. Something Anna had been planning. So he told the truth. "At her place."

"Why didn't you stay at an inn or hostel?"

"Well, I was short on cash."

"Yet you made the trip from America," Anna noted skeptically.

"My wallet must have been picked at the airport I reckon."

"So **Electra Samaras** just let you stay at her house?" She asked, impatience rising.

"I didn't hear any complaints," Creed responded defensively--but just how he might defend himself he hadn't the foggiest. He had no plans on digging his heels into this part of his story. It would have to be developed somehow.

"So she trusted you?"

"Trust may be a little strong a term. She seemed on her guard. Not uncomfortable, just wary." He wished he hadn't said it. It was going to make Electra's interrogation all the trickier. "Like she would for any stranger," he added.

"The kindness of strangers. Also most unsatisfying."

"What the hell would be satisfying?" Creed demanded.

"What were you doing at that beach?"

"I was swimming. What else do you do at a beach? There was a whole crowd, it was high noon on Saturday. Why the hell don't you ask the 87 other people that witnessed the event?"

"We did," Anna informed, ignoring Creed's tone. "They said you two were the only ones who stayed in the water and lived. Well, plus the girl, whom you conveniently kept above water throughout the incident."

"That doesn't mean I know anything."

"I suppose not," Anna seemed to concede. "But that would make your story all the more troubling. I'm afraid I shall have to imagine an answer very much against your wishes. I feel I could start with you conspiring with Electra. That shouldn't bother you too much, should it? I mean you only just met."

"Yes it should bother me, after I saved her child," Creed corrected.

"So you did save her child? Knew she needed saving? You must have survived a previous attack."

"Does this kind of thing regularly happen in this part of the country? It isn't in any of the travel literature."

"Oh, it does happen from time-to-time," Anna's more cheery demeanor led Creed to believe she was hiding something. "And exposure can lead to infection." Anna produced two needles and put one on a flat try. "Let me get you something for that." She tied a piece of rubber around his arm, looking for a vein. "Stick," she finally said, and pushed the needle in. "Of course, killing the infection tends to kill the host. Poison," she clarified.

"I don't see that I'm getting anywhere. What were you doing between the time you landed on the plane and the time of the attack?"

Creed had no idea what time he had left, and took a gamble, "You need me alive."

"Ha!" Anna chuckled. "Do I?"

"You have a mass attack of creatures not supposed to exist and 87 witnesses," he reminded her.

"That's a problem for Athens." Anna replied.

"Very much a problem for Athens," A man barking in Greek entered the door. "Give him the antidote. You're being relieved." Creed could feel his lungs tighten, and his breaths came quickly.

"This is my interrogation," Anna protested.

"Not any more. Your bosses performed an extraction outside their jurisdiction," The man tossed the woman aside and jammed the antidote into Creed's arm.

Anna looked up at the man in disgust. "He knows something. Something he shouldn't. You better find out what it is, or mark my words he's too dangerous to live."

"Thank you for that assessment. I'll bear it in mind," the man bellowed. Anna tried to maintain some dignity on leaving, but stormed out just the same.

"She's quite the angel of death, don't you think?" the man asked, offering Creed a cigarette.

"I don't smoke." Creed looked up at him. There was no telling if his intent was any different than Anna's, and that the only mistake that had been made was bureaucratic toe-stepping. The man unplugged the security camera. Then he looked at Creed expectantly, waiting for something.

"Aren't you going to ask me why you're here?" the man said at last.

"I haven't been treated like someone who's going to get an answer to that question."

"I suppose not. Standard military treatment, mercifully short," the man said.

"Short?" Creed spit out in exasperation.

"Oh they can drag you through this your entire life, if they want. That's what they do whenever something like this happens."

"Something like this?" Creed looked for clarification.

"Well, when one man doubts all, he risks the philosophers. When society doubts all, it risks the military. Any time their is a true ambiguity, not mere social unrest but a real unresolved social problem, force presents itself as a solution. Like clockwork are the instruments of death. Both truth and uncertainty resolve fade forever under their guidance."

"Guidance to where? Who are you?"

"HADES of course. Nothing ever escapes the land of the dead."

"So I've been told," Creed said in irritation, "many times."

"But you really don't know why. That's why you keep getting the reminders," the man explained.

"Are you here to tell me why?"

"No. You can't just be told why. You have to make a choice first."

"I've made plenty of choices recently," Creed noted.

"Yes, then let me offer you another," the man said, holding a vial of yellow murk. The Oracles of Delphi made cryptic pronouncements. They were thought to enter a trance like state in making their prophecies, but your classics departments have never really figured out how they did it. This is their secret. They called it the Blood of Apollo."

"What will happen if I take it?"

"How should I know? Who knows the content of a prophecy before it's made?"

"I'll take it," Creed said without much thought

"That was quick. No second thoughts?"

"I'm not cutting off my adventure in the middle, no am I?" Creed declared.

"I suppose the point of no return is long gone for you. I'm glad you see that clearly. Drink."

"Yes, drink," Creed responded, and downed the substance. It was sweet but difficult to swallow. Creed saw the room flicker, then blink out of existence. He was in some old, well maintained but poorly ventilated structure. The day outside must have been quite hot. Creed saw many parallel corridors down a wall and wondered if he might have wandered into a labyrinth. But as the static cleared, he saw many figures in robes, moving quietly, scrolls in their hands.

Slowly taking the world in, he noticed a female figure close by trying to get his attention. She was not speaking to him in modern Greek, nor was it ancient. It seemed familiar, but he couldn't place it. She spoke slowly and softly, as if to a lover.

"Let me give you a tour of the library." He finally made out. "My name is Lydia."

"Dr. Creed."

"You're from Greece? The land of Alexander?" she inquired enthusiastically.

"No, I'm from America, but I studied in Greece."

"America? I've not heard of such a land. But there are men from many lands of which I know little. Perhaps tonight you might tell me something about it?"

"I don't know how long I'll be here, Lydia."

"Oh, then all the more important." She took her hand in his. He'd never felt such smoothness. "But first let me show you the library."

"Are you a librarian?"

She giggled. "No, I'm one of the library's ambassadors. I'm here to make those of foreign lands welcome in this place."

Lydia's appearance was slowly becoming more vivid. She more a long linen robe, around which she had a purple sash. Something seemed significant about the sash, but he couldn't place it. He let her smooth hand guide him into the library. But there were no books. The library was several floors high, with slots for scrolls.

"What kind of library is this?" Creed asked.

"The finest in world," Lydia replied, with great pride. I do not mean to insult your homeland of course, but I doubt it has a greater depository of scholarship than Alexandria. That is no doubt why you are here."

"The Library of Alexandria!" Dr. Creed exclaimed.

"Please be courteous of our other scholars and restrain your voice. You speak as if you don't know where you are. You came to the city of Alexander the liberator for its library did you not?"

"Of course, but then, I should expect a male ambassador," Creed declared.

"Do not be insulted. I'm certain, if you come from such a far off land as America you have business of extended time. I'm certain you will have many conversations with many learned men. But in this city we also have some fine learned women. If you should desire their company..."

"Oh," Creed caught the innuendo.

"You sound disappointed."

"No. No. You just don't strike me as a..."

"I do not know your American customs, Dr. Creed, but a woman's company is nothing to be ashamed of here. Many men confess to me they grow tired of women without education."

"Then as an educated woman you can show me the library?"

"Yes. You are familiar with the Greek script no doubt. Are you familiar with any other? Does America have its own script?" Lydia asked.

"It does, though I doubt you'd find it here."

"Oh, Doctor Creed, this is a library! If it can be found anywhere, it can be found here. Is the American script pictorial, character based, or alphabetic?"

"It's alphabetic."

"And its material? We Egyptians have a reed called papyrus. It's highly compact and can be easily compiled. Though I'm sure you can gather that by wandering the library."

"We have paper," Creed informed.

"Perhaps an exchange can be made? We have an acquisitions department. Is there any knowledge your kingdom would greatly value? We can supply it."

Yes, Creed thought, there was material here to fill a hundred journals. Perhaps there might have been better things, but there were his two stories that needed explanation. They prove nothing but fanciful tales according to classical scholarship, but they were a part of his adventure, and seemed more important than anything else.

"I had something in mind in coming here. A structure." Creed said vaguely.

"I can lead you to scrolls about architecture and the building trades," Lydia offered.

"I think I might be better in the history section. It was an ancient structure. Before Alexander's time."

"Was it widely written about? A copy might exist in circulation. Otherwise you might have to consult our rare collections, which will take time."

"Widely written about?" Creed wondered. He had seen single copies in his office, but how many existed through history he did not know. "It's difficult to say. The structure was of great height, and it fell, disastrously so. In my land we are building something. Something quite tall. I had heard of a story of something of great height collapsing. I'm hoping to learn why."

"Is this project a pyramid? That is the most stable of structures, and we have many texts on geometry if that would assist. Then there is our Egyptian heritage of pyramids."

"Buildings that will remain long after humanity has passed?"

"Man fears time and time fears pyramids they say. If it's a pyramid you're considering about they don't collapse. It's easy enough to note that the base is wider than the top. But there's something more. If the angle is too sharp, too ambitious, the builders can see that before the construction is finished and moderate the angle. Only kings and architects notice," Lydia stated proudly.

"That's interesting," Creed responded. Lydia was becoming more physical. It was still difficult to make out the features of her face but the curves of her body were becoming more apparent. So too was the saturation of papyrus coming from a structure without central ventilation. "But this structure is vertical. It has to be of proper conception. I've heard of another story."

"There is one I can think of, but it's not in Greek script. It's an older alphabet before the Greeks." Creed paused to reflect on his expression. He knew his points of historical reference were different than Lydia's and he hadn't quite described his Greek text exactly.

"Phoenician?"

"Um, perhaps..." Creed wondered if the scrolls had been compiled by age, not script, and that this might point them in the right direction.

"That would be your first alphabet. It is an alphabet you're looking for? I would hope you can speak Phoenician. You can't really read an alphabet without speaking it as well--their big downfall. If you were looking for hieroglyphs I could fetch a scribe for you."

"I'd prefer an ambassador," Creed replied, mostly out of not wanting to lose his guide. He felt he spoke in haste, however, for as he watched Lydia's purple sash it did not quite seem to move in complete accordance with the rest of her body or clothes.

"Excellent," she wriggled her hips a little, "You'll speak well of the kingdom of Ptolemies. I guarantee it. So, you speak Phoenician? Or will you need papyrus and ink for transcription? Of course the library is a big place, I might be able to locate a scholar for you."

"Let's find the scroll first," Creed suggested.

"Yes, let's."

Dr. Creed have grave doubts Lydia could find the work described so vaguely amidst so many other texts. The library's classification scheme might not have a classification system as broad or deep as a modern library, let alone the speed of something like the Internet. Personal knowledge of the library's idiosyncrasies would have a great role to play. Creed would not have minded this had he been certain he was actually in the library. Browsing the Library of Alexandria was a classical scholar's unbridled fantasy. Less than a dozen of these scrolls could secure an academic future. But how exactly he was going to transport said scrolls across time and space was beyond his imagination. 

Lydia led Dr. Creed downstairs. She began muttering to herself in strange language. Occasionally a Greek word would slip in, and surprisingly some Hebrew ones. Then Lydia began walking down past a few aisles. Dr. Creed was still breathless to see scroll after scroll.

"Just of curiosity, what do they trade in America?" Lydia asked.

"Trade?"

"Yes. Iron, olives, gold, cotton, quarries? What do you make? What do you eat? Do all Americans dress as you do? You don some awfully strange fabrics."

Creed looked down at his clothing. He was not in his swimming trunks, as he had been, but a t-shirt and jeans. Strange dress for such a time and place, and he became aware that any person in his vision would perceive him to be a foreigner. But he resolved that it did not matter. They would deduce only that he was from a strange place, not a strange time, and go about his business. After some pause he sought ought to explain. "This," Dr. Creed pointed to his jeans, "Is denim. It's both quite flexible and durable."

"You must speak with the merchants before you return. It should fetch a high price, this fabric made in America."

"Yes, well..."

"Here is the scroll," Lydia pointed.

"You found it rather quickly."

"A man was here recently, with a great beard. He marked the scroll with a few strange characters of an obscure alphabet before being told it was improper," Lydia informed.

Dr. Creed looked down at the writing. It was Hebrew.

"I've seen this language before," Creed stated.

"He said his god had charged him to scour the earth for his religious texts. He claimed to be of a persecuted sect that believed his nation's sacred texts were incomplete. He was hoping to complete the collection, and bring honor to his band of heretics."

Dr. Creed carefully unwrapped the scroll.

#### The Collapse of the Temple of the Alphabet

In a kingdom of ancient origin whose name is now forgotten lived a statue maker. He was beloved by the king for both the detail and grandeur of his work. He had constructed for his king the tallest freestanding statue that had ever been. It was a great wonder, and brought many a visitor and the awe of other kings.

It was a great blessing to his majesty who used it wisely. If his kingdom could produce statues of such nature, he spread the rumors around that his siege machines would be of equal marvel. Thus did the king spare himself the expense of a great army, by which his city prospered and he lived in luxury.

But, impressive as the statue was, the king saw its limits to shock and awe. So he commissioned his statue maker to build a temple of such height that no one would ever question his kingdom's power. He informed the statue maker that nothing could be too bold—so long as the structure was sound.

The statue maker told the king he could not imagine such a structure on his own. He asked to speak to a great trader, a great general, and a great scholar, and the king gathered the three of them together.

"What," he asked the scholar, "is the nature of the trade between nations?"

"All nations are rich in some things and poor in others. One values what one lacks more than what one has in abundance. Thus nations exchange."

"What" he asked the general, "is the nature of war between nations?"

"Nations construct armies. Each does so in its own way. One nation sees to its advantage to produce more arrows, the other to produce more shields. If the arrows pierce the shields one nation is the wiser, if the shields repel the arrows, the other nation is wiser. The wisest, of course, inspects the shields and arrows before their strengths are demonstrated in combat."

"What" he asked the scholar, "is the nature of knowledge amongst the nations?"

"Each scholar lives in his own country, and seeing the state of his country, determines which knowledge should be the most profitable to gain. The country gains knowledge when the country's opinions are in accordance with truth, and increases in ignorance when its opinions are not in accordance with truth. The wisest of countries send scholars to investigate the opinions of other nations, for only then is it able to see beyond the falsehoods of its own."

"Thus in knowledge, war, and trade other nations have riches of different kinds. I submit to you then, oh King, that the nation that understands the extent of the riches of other nations shall have the greatest glory."

"How then," asked the king, "shall thou uncover the riches of other nations?"

"All the nations have different tongues. I shall construct a temple with the words of all peoples. I shall make their words like unto stones, and when I have finished my temple there will be one language whose temple shall be ours."

"Then it shall be so." proclaimed the king. "Gather scribes and masons of all nations together and we will build this temple."

And so it was that temple began. In the beginning there was great frustration, for giving orders in the languages of all nations was difficult. So too, there developed a transitory tongue amongst the builders during the construction, such that there was doubt all words could be compiled.

But many a wonder happened during the building of the temple. For at times when word-stone was placed upon word-stone all the names for a thing became known. And when word-stone was placed upon word-stone it was discovered the number of sounds used by the tongues of nations was actually quite small. And as the temple was built marvel upon marvel revealed how the tongues of nations that had seemed so different were quite the same. And the scribes and masons began to hold it as fact that when the temple was finished it would be revealed that all tongues of nations would be revealed to be the same—though there was a great debate as to why they should seem so different.

The construction of the temple was beyond the generation of the statue maker. So it was agreed upon by the king that the first born in the line of the statue maker should have a wife of the great nations, and that each born after that should have wives of lesser nations and tribes, such that the progeny of the first statue maker could continue in the building of the temple, for it was known that children were better at learning the many tongues than their parents.

During the third generation of the construction of the temple there arrived a scribe from a kingdom so distant that no one could recall hearing of it, and this scribe came with a secret called paper. This secret, though flimsy and weak to every element, was capable of transcribing words on a fraction of the size of the word-stones. There was great talk that building of the temple might stop, but this was set to rest by the first born of the temple builders, who proposed something different. The paper could be used to plan the placement of the word stones temporarily so they could be easily set in place. He chose the most lingual of his brethren to begin this acceleration of the project--and paper increased building speed several fold.

What was thought would take seven generations would now take four. But as the temple reached completion on paper a strange thing occurred. A small band containing some of the brightest linguists fled in panic with only what their backs could carry and boarded the ship of a distant nation at night. It was rumored, though with little evidenced, that they settled amongst a sea-faring nation named Phoenicia.

The inexplicable reason for their terror became known after a certain time had passed. The temple of the one language had not yet been finished. However, it had reached a height that, it became possible for the masons of each nation to converse with each other in something other than vague construction orders. Then it was discovered how one nation considered the many other nations as savages, and how those many other nations viewed that nation as savages, and the scribes and masons set upon each other, and the armies of those nations fought desperately amongst themselves for the right to destroy the temple.

Creed looked up "So an alphabet is the remains of a one language that the nations of the world rejected? Violently?"

"Yes," Lydia replied, and disrobed. The beautiful curves hinted under Lydia's robes were made entirely of fire, and Dr. Creed could clearly see her with twelve arms, juggling twelve torches.

"The Library of Alexandria must burn. You knew that." Lydia's smooth voice becoming overbearing.

"But you said you were one of the library's ambassadors!" Dr. Creed objected. He knew his protest was futile, but he had to make it anyway. "How can you burn so many scrolls of such value?"

"Men have spoken truths to me in the night that a hundred scrolls could not transcribe. I am gracing you with a choice. You can burn to ashes and save the scroll. Or you can trust that the scroll of the Hebrew captures the story sufficiently and live."

"The rest of the library lost forever?" Creed wailed.

"Yes. The Library of Alexandria burned and nothing can change that. You can determine if this physical scroll will survive. Hold to it fast and race out the way you came or don my robe, through which no fire can pass.

He looked at the scroll. It was the exact sort of text he thought he'd give anything for. He dropped it for the cloak. Navigating out of the library was of great difficulty. The cloak covered all light and heat, so it was impossible to know exactly where he was going. Initially he bumped into shelves frequently. But as he continued to walk, this was less and less the case. It occurred to him that perhaps the reason for this was that the robe allowed him to walk through objects that were on fire.

A sudden fear jolted through him that if this were the case he'd never know when to lift the robe. But this conundrum was solved when someone he ran into someone far enough from the flames who curiously lifted his robe.

Dr. Creed awoke with a start. The unnamed agent of HADES stood over him, and wiped the sweat off his brow. "You're back in the room you were in Dr. Creed, in safety. You may feel some lingering effects for the next few hours."

"The tower will fall, but it will not fall through the act of one nation alone," came out of Creed's lips.

"Ah, Apollo's tongue. It may come and go." The man informed, before closing a notebook. He felt he must have been observed during the vision. Had his mouth uttered the words of his vision out loud? The man turned to go.

"You said I was safe here?" Creed asked.

"Relatively. I suppose you are only really safe from your own vision. How safe you have been all along is something I you must decide. And discover."

"I need a Bible," Creed told the man.

"Yes, I suppose the vision is not complete without it. But you're from America. I think you should be acquainted with that book. Focus on that memory, and your lingering vision should do the rest. You will have what you need. I have what I need." 

Creed wished to protest, but had already started concentrating. He felt himself quite unable to react to the questions in his mind outside the things to resolve in his vision. He tried to focus on the Bible's structure, something he remembered was strangely missing in his religious education. The book's authors, when and in what context the chapters were written. The vast majority of his religious experience had been dealing with the Bible in citations, sometimes chapters but frequently just verses. Little citations.

But then, that was what he was looking for too, was it not? A citation. A citation from a story before Jesus--Old Testament, before the history of the Jews, in a beginning. This meant Genesis, and he tried to recall chapter and verse. He had not read the Bible in some time, but then the story he was looking for, Babel, washed into him. 

#### The First Book of Moses called Genesis chapter 11:1-9

1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech
2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there
3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar
4. And they said, Go to, let us build a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
5. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
6. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language, and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
8. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth, and they left off to build the city.
9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all earth, and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad open the face of all the earth.

In remembering it, it seemed like his decision was guided not by choosing a better story, but simply not wanting to die. The story wasn't seem the same. His was vivid, in the flesh, real. The biblical version was short and vague. Still, important parts of the story coincided. The Tower of Words was to be the grandest structure devised on the power of a universal language. Likewise did the Tower of Babel reach unto heaven. 

Creed looked for other points of agreement, but his mind kept leaning towards the contradictions. The Tower of Words was a gift constructed, and the Towel of Babel was a gift rescinded. The tower of Babel spoke of a humanity to great, The Tower of Words revealed a human weakness, hidden among the confounded languages. The weight and struggle of the many languages could be overcome. But the weight of judgment, self-righteousness, and cultural fanaticism--that no human construction could bear. No Lord was needed to bring down a tower of universal human language--that we could do on our own, and that message seemed lost in the Biblical version.

But there were other versions of this story; he had been presented with two back in his office. The construction and fall of a great towering monolith. That story of Atlantis, the floating tower of Atlantis, and it's greed for the stars, for something not of this earth, something transcendent, something not to be reached on a foundation of water. Greed too, had been present in the Egyptian story, in the form of lust. A harem without measure--in the afterlife. Another transcendence, sexual ecstasy, not to be approached in this life--despite this transcendence being an earthly delight. And what was left was not the Pharaoh's line, but inanimate objects of such size as to outlast the human race, or at least it's empires.

In every story existed a culture whose structures exceeded their reach. Sometimes a divinity intervened, in others a truth intervened and the structures fell to their own contradictions. Still, they all maintained this tragedy, this fall from greatness. But even though that character remained in the only surviving version of the tale, Creed the burning of his own text of one great personal loss.

A highly developed language was amongst the things that was uniquely human. The other apes had precursors, could grasp it in chunks. But that ability to stitch together memories into stories, stories into histories, phenomenon into ideas, ideas into experiments, love in letters, pain into poetry, judgments into laws, persons into tribes, and yes, iron into swords, held great power that needed a story. A narrative like the tower of words. Not a mere explanation of the many languages as God's whim towards an ancient people. 

But, in the end, the tower of Babel was the one that lived, and not merely in the text of the Bible. The Bible had been full of stories, his early education had made this well known. But it was a large work, and many of its stories were lost to mainstream American thought. People remembered things like David and Goliath, or Noah's Ark, whilst a hundred forgotten stories lay hidden to those not actively reading the Bible. The Tower of Babel had captured people's imaginations, just as those Biblical stories had, just as the story of Atlantis had. There were variations, artworks, apocryphal literature surrounding the tale, perhaps enough that if he compiled it all, it might contain the power of his own story several times over. 

And that realization struck him hard. He had been searching his academic career for forgotten figures, unsatisfied with the idea that existing tales might tell our story well enough, particularly if they were properly compiled by a conscientious scholar and editor. That history, despite it's distortion from the oversimplification of the documents and the institution that wanted its power to captivate minds for its own purposes, contained the lessons humanity needed be never seemed to grasp. 

But what of the Theatre of HADES? Were these new tales being compiled for him, and under the hands of what editor, filled with what motives? The idea that reality was fluid, this was present in all these films, but the details were only loosely related and contradictory. What was he really facing? He did not know, but he decided, for now at least, that vague fragment of a chapter on the confounding of language was part of his compilation, just like the films, just like the human figures presumably not real. 

Now, he thought, there was nothing left to do but escape the confines of the military, which would crush any truth incompatible with order. First, of course, he had to escape the room undetected, which meant surviving any more potential interrogators.
