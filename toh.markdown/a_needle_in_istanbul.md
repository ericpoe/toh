Status: Complete::Development
Synopsis: Walter tells Creed a cautionary tale from his own youthful ambition, to discover the origins of science in Arabic scholarship. He had in fact discovered a text that might do that, but just like Jonathon the text disappeared and he was left with a HADES theatre ticket. Walter provides caution and tells how he moved to his new topic the history of 20th century theoretical physics. It's revealed he still has a ticket to the Theatre of Hades from a text that he found but lost, just like Jonathon.

After dropping Phoenix off at a grimy apartment building to return to her four roommates, Jonathon took a turn towards the presitigious University of Chicago. It was the presitigious institution that he'd long dreamed of teaching in when visits to his uncle had been so taboo. He knew the number and location of his uncle's office, though circumstances had always seem to make him put off a visit. After breathing deeply and trying to collect himself, he knocked.

"Walter Creed's office," a man said mechanically.

"It's your nephew. It's Jonathon.

"Jonny!" William said in delight, tossing down a few papers and grabbing his cane. "You know your father would very much disapprove of our meeting."

"Screw him." 

"Oh how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child! What brings on the visit? You don't write. You don't call. Not an email or text. I'm even on Facebook this days, much as I try to avoid it."

"It was a last minute decision, to be sure."

"Jonny you aren't on a run from the law now are you? There's only so much more adventure left in these old bones."

"Or trees to add to the clutter in your office." 

William looked about. "Well, the milk crates are an improvement. Back in my day you couldn't see the floor. I've decided I'm important enough that some scholar will want to go through my paper and write a book about me. Why should I bother getting things in order for him?"

"You can clean when you're dead?" Jonathon asked.

"I suppose."

"Well, I have a question."

"One which merits a personal visit? You have my attention."

"Yes. Your professional opinion."

"Oh? Still having trouble getting published?"

"I've been working on a history project."

"Still the Atlantis stuff? I saw you on television."

"I really wish you hadn't."

"Why not? You did a great job, you know. Took on the role of stuffy professor that doesn't believe in fairy tales and wants real evidence with utmost earnestness."

"I didn't do it as a joke."

"I know you didn't. It's just a character you keep having to take on, when you believe in evidence and someone believes in something else."

"Well, I've come across some evidence I'm having difficulty believing."

"You have? That's the very best kind. At least... if holds fast in the face of skepticism."

"Yes, well, I ran into a snag. I had access to some documents. The very oldest."

"Oh?"

"I made a translation, but I lost the originals."

"Original singular, or originals plural?"

"Plural actually. One of them's more in my area of expertise, and very much in contradiction to the known texts of Greece. And I can't, I don't have the physical document. It needed document analysis. If it stood up to the tests, I would have my publication. It's what I've been looking for! But it's lost."

"Hmm..." Walter mused. "Shut the door, and lock it."

"You have some secret?"

"More of a tale to tell, and I don't want to be interrupted." 

"What is this tale?"

"It was right after I read Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions". As you can imagine, I was full of intellectual zeal. What Kuhn was really talking about, were those periods of science where two explanations fit the same phenomena, and they could both potentially explain the evidence. Over time, of course, evidence mounted in one direction. But the losing school of thought, well, they never accepted the other school, always they continued to twist their school to fit the facts. But newer students didn't have the investment see, and saw the better solution."

"So what happened?"

"Oh, give an incorrugable lecturer a little time to ramble. I was fascinated, and, through a series of imaginative leaps, I started questioning the first Scientific Revolution, aptly called the Scientific Revolution. History, I think, builds gradually. We only think of in terms of grand thrusts because no one wants to explore the boring stuff, the actual perusal of documents. Well, I got it into my head that there were unguessed inspirations in that term period. I thought maybe the old Islamic empire, that had been the seat of knowledge before the Renaissance, may have anticipated it. 

"So I set out to learn the languages, Arabic, Turkish. I set out to learn the flowering culture of that Empire, so chaotic and cut into tiny waring pieces now. It was not a common subject in my day. Historians were much more Eurocentric then they are now. I set out to make a name for myself in the field, sketched out a tour of the great Middle Eastern universities, rummage through their rare collections. 

"I was in Istanbul, the Western tip of the Middle East. The collections department wasn't open at the late hours but I was exhausted from my tour. I found something of great interest. So, in the Islamic tradition, Mohammed is the last Prophet, sent by Allah to reveal the final correct teaching of the God of Abraham. Of course, why the question of why God didn't just give the correct version to Abraham is one of those chicaneries religions engage in to give special status to their own prophets. 'The people weren't ready for the truth,' they say, but then how the people are going to prepare themselves with an incomplete or fragmentary truth..."

"Have to interrupt you there Uncle. Fragmentary truth?"

"Well, yes, that's always how it goes isn't it? If the person has a new truth to tell, and they don't want to contradict tradition, they just call it fragmentary. It's very effect mental gymnastics. It allows people to ascertain new and better ideas without having to admit they were wrong about the old ones. But I digress. This is about my story. So anyway I was in Istanbul, reading this writer, who was greatly concerned with the idea of a last prophet. That meant that while the concepts and morality of Islam were complete. But history is ongoing see. So that meant the collective experience of all peoples after the Koran would never be clarified by a prophet. You could only interpret, and without a prophet, everyone could interpret differently. 
So he asked himself, what can we know outside of interpretation?"

Walter stopped for a moment, and Creed thought he was letting a point set in.

"I forget myself Jonny. You know a different kind of history. That's the question that leads to science. What can I know without resulting to prophets, dogmas, holy texts, unseen divinities? This question leads one to really the pinnacle of science. Not just the experiments and the laws of nature. How can I live a life in which all my knowledge can be shown to be false? How should I live my life in which all my knowledge can be shown to be false? The writer, being religious, was greatly concern with morals, not what we'd come to see as science. But the ideas were so compelling I was sure I'd find citations and I'd have my brilliant paper. 

"But I fell asleep, in the afternoon sun, and when I woke up the text wasn't there any more. But there was this strange business card. It said HADES."

"That's what I came to ask you about! I got one too. What did you do with it?"

"It's here somewhere. It doesn't do anything. It just displays that word, HADES. I really only kept it as a memento. Yes see, my researches didn't get me anywhere. I thought in that one moment, I had really turned the history of science on its head. I thought I had pierced the veil of history with a needle and caught a glimpse of the other side. But it went nowhere. The veil's puncture just... headled. Then I started the line of inquiry that was to bring the glory. The great drama of relativity against quantum mechanics. All I have from those days are the card and the bookmark I jostled a cryptic note on. You will see life and death where two great rivers meet."

"I've never figured it out. Hell, I never had to."

"Well, I want to figure my riddle out. I don't have time to change course like you did."

"Time? You call the years worth of calculus and physics I had on top of a history degree something that didn't take time?"

"Ok, so maybe I could change course. That's the very thing I came to talk to you about. I got the same card, HADES. Not the same documents, but the same riddle, that same moment of puncture. Only I want to solve it."

"I understand. So I have to tell you what happened with me. The early twentieth century, physics was on fire. The sheer weight and counterintiutiveness of the discoveries... I realized there was a real story there, and I knew from the journals that it wasn't getting told well enough. So I did the goddamn math, and I told the story. I didn't let a flash of imagination control my life. I let the true story of the emergence of a whole new world view guide my life."

"I don't think following the flash is surrending control of your life. Besides, I already know what the card is."

"You do?"

"It's a ticket to the Theatre of HADES. I've been there. I watched a film. What I don't understand is why these tickets should appear, under such strange circumstances. If the theatre is involved with the underworld, it shouldn't be in the land of the living. I have to find out why. Do you think after all this time you can go back to that moment? That needle in Istanbul?"

"If you know where you're going."

"Where two great rivers meet. St. Louis."
