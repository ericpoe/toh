Road Trips and Hospital Beds

Dr. Creed called for a nurse to give him a glass of water. He thought he heard a suppress groan from the nurse. He'd asked for water many times. He'd had a considerable fever, and reflexively turned to drinking water to cool himself down. It offered no relief. He wanted to take off his dressing gown and lie naked to cool off, but he suffered to wear a thin hospital gown.

It was flu season, but he'd never suffered a contagion quite like this before. He started getting inexplicably hot, but he had papers to grade, and neglected it. He had wanted to get everything done which involved teaching Greek so he could concentrate on his translations, on the business of history, and examining the riddle of HADES. In this rush he'd forgotten his health, and now he was stuck in the hospital with a dangerous fever, 102.3 by the nurse's last check up. Yet, for some reason, he lacked a sneeze, cough, or any other sign of an infectious disease. He was still waiting on test results.

He didn't know if he could recover for the television program, and if he did it would probably be used for this hospital stay and not a vacation. He hadn't been to Greece for six years. The stabbing pain in his chest and difficulty breathing might have been bearable if not for this, this endless stretch of nothing to do but lie around and be burning like a boiler plate.

In his delirium he still remembered finding to his dismay that he'd lost all the notes, sources, and writings he'd done regarding Solon. It was difficult to consider his theses at the current moment, but he felt their absence much as he did his unrelenting fever. Who and what had been out of his office kept recurring to him, but only in lapses between the heat.

 	He wanted to reconstruct his work once his fever calmed, but his sister the only family member in proximity) had refused to bring him any academic material saying he needed time to rest his mind.

But before he made his way to the ER, stashed away a few books that in his fevered state he had thought to bring: One Hundred Years of Solitude, an untranslated copy of Medea, Europe on $5/day, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Edith Hamilton's Mythology. This was supplemented by a copy of US Today, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and the November issue of Penny Press' Variety Puzzles, purchased from the hospital gift shop. There was a television, but he generally didn't watch television.

He glanced through the USA Today. He hoped for news of happenings in Minnesota, or at least somewhere in the North, regarding severe winter weather that would cool him down just by reading it. The Great Lakes region was in for a blizzard, which like his illness he had neglected to prepare for.

As he continued reading, he noted an opinion piece on public education that said nothing new and an article over the bail outs in Greece which he read with interest. He wanted to see the country after the world financial crisis but the chance missed year after year. Greece throughout history was more notable for its ability to inspire than its ability to govern.

It would be a place of social unrest, true, but this bred in him only caution and not intimidation. He'd been in places with a lot less order than the United States. You learned to carry phrase books for half a dozen languages, to note landmarks, to keep money inside your clothing, and to use water and electricity at every opportunity, because you didn't know if you'd have them later. If rioting might be involved, you didn't gather in the town square. Having to deal with all this alertness seem to terrify the rest of his family, that was always relieved to hear he'd canceled plans again as if he'd been saved from death.

Dr. Creed let his copy of the newspaper slide out of his hands and drop by the bed. At some point he'd call the nurse for more water and she'd pick it up along with picking up a book from his bag—whatever he could read without strain for hours. He went to his copy of the Star Tribune. It too, held little of note. He supposed, this was the point, not to strain his mind with anything interesting. But something strange began to happen with the paper. Flecks of red seemed to flash through the paper, as though the fibers were changing from dull grey to crimson red. He'd look at an article and swore he could see liquid on it, almost as if the paper, like himself was sweating with fever.

He didn't think himself so ill as to be delirious. He opened up his puzzle book to see if the paper was changing in the same manner. It wasn't. He strained his eyes to see if the fibers were actually still wet with red ink. Then he had a coughing fit onto the front page and decided it didn't matter. He would just flip through the pages to see where if he could find any stains. In the final page, the opinion section, he found the following blurb:



Freedom of religion is a commandment from God whose sanctity cannot be trampled upon. The murder of a child is murder. It does not matter if tht child is elected. That child has a right to take up the call to office, and we must respect that right and put that child in office.



located in what appeared to be an article defending a number of anti-abortion laws passed throughout the country. The rest of the article then proceeded as though nothing happened. There were no other pages like this. Dr. Creed folded the paper up neatly, tried to bundle it up as it came, except for discarding the front cover. Then he opened it up again, going back to the offending blurb. Unlike his mysterious documents, it was still there. He didn't know what to think. He called a nurse for water  and occupied his mind on word puzzles. He asked for his copy of a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to be adjusted a bit so he could read better.

The book read a little differently this time around. The earth is about to be destroyed. Ford Prefect comes to save his friend Arthur Dent by hitching a ride on the spaceship that came to destroy it.  Human kind is oblivious. The only species aware of the coming destruction are the interdimensional beings that present themselves as mice, and dolphins, who leave earth in mass with the response “So long, and thanks for all the fish.”

“So long, and thanks for all the frustration,” Dr. Creed uttered, and then let himself curl into this fantasy of interstellar travel. Without a roommate or anyone else to occupy him, he lost track of time until dinner, around five o' clock. Without a pair of hands to keep a book open, he decided to turn on the 5 o'clock news.

The story to plaster the news for the rest of the hour was the story of a rollover of diesel truck carrying liquid nitrogen, that had overturned on Highway 52, freezing the roads and causing a multicar pile up. Snow would pick up the next day or two and it was urgent to clear the wreckage. The truck driver had been reported to have been admitted to the same hospital. Perhaps the driver might still have some liquid nitrogen stashed away, though once Dr. Creed had the strength to go find said trucker, his fever would likely be over. Then there was the issue of finding the fellow, though he imagined he'd simply have to follow the reporters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dr. Creed found himself amongst a crowd of robed figures shouting. They carried torches and were moving in so many directions it was difficult to tell what all the agitation was about. A white robed figure thrust at him from behind so that he want sprawling. Looking up it was impossible to tell who was responsible. But the figures began to take on a pattern of two concentric circles. Every so often two members of the circles interchanged. The effect was a strange circular wall such that the inside could not be seen. The sky was dark and the movement of torches was disorienting.

A man began speaking Latin, and the torchbearers repeated his pronouncements. After sensing a  hole in their pattern he barged his way through to see three women, naked, tied to poles. Amongst them was a pile of manuscripts, presumably heretical.

The Latin slowly grew more and more difficult to hear, turning from sonorous to guttural. Looking over at the figure making pronouncements it was now the head of a jackal. Disgusted at this barbaric sacrifice he ran to remove the manuscripts that would serve as kindle. The women began to screech, and he felt a terrible fear that he did not think to untie them first.

He turned to look at the figure making the pronouncements and saw his own face. The figure untied the women, and the circle but all the manuscripts under just one pole, to which his body was tied. In terror he tried to prepare himself to be scorched, shuttered, and awoke in a cold sweat. He had not been asleep long, and his fever seemed more unbearable than before.

He looked over to his left. The nurses were bringing in a man with a jangled system of casts and splints. There were some obvious broken bones, though for where he lay it was difficult to tell which ones, just that there were many. The nurse was setting up an IV and the man wasn't saying much of anything. But given that his fever hadn't gone down it looked like this was his new roommate.

He was still too shaken from his dream to take much note. He was still terrified. He'd been put to some deadly test and deemed a failure. This weighed greatly on his anxiety, even in the state he was in. He asked the nurses moving his roommate for a bedpan and some water. He had been hooked up to an IV but he was still burning up and hoping to cool. He didn't even look over or get up before urinating. His thoughts were too strained for such considerations. He just sat and waited for his roommate to get settled before asking a nurse to dispose of his waste.

He tried going to sleep, but he wasn't quite sure he was successful. He at least remembered being startled by a clamor from his roommate.

“I said no reporters!” he exclaimed. “I'm not giving them an update. Tell them you haven't changed the status of my condition and ask them to leave.”

Dr. Creed didn't really look up to confirm what was going on. An angry man being badgered by the press, an overturned truck on the highway—it was probably the driver.

“Vultures!” he proclaimed. “No respect for privacy. I'm just another headline.” He seemed to be talking to a wall, probably because he couldn't move his head. “How do I make them go away?”

“Give them a history lesson,” Dr. Creed offered. It was about the best humor he could muster.

It elicited riotous laugh from the trucker. “Great I've got a funny man for a roommate. My bones will never set. With that attention span of theirs it just might work. And I can go on about history, believe me.”

“Oh?”

“A genuine Civil War buff. Hitchhiked from site to site. Done a little reenactment too, but not really my thing. Had to put a break on it when I knocked up a wife.”

“So... now you've gotta get paid to stay on the road.”

“Yeah. That's the brakes. Don't even know how well that's going to turn out. Every damn reporter is another job offer turned down, ya know?”

“So what did happen, if you don't mind me asking?”

“If you can keep your trap shut I might just tell you. Not that you'd believe me.”

“I'd believe anything.”

“People would call that stupid.”

“But not you?”

“The transmission... it... well, changing gears in a rig ain't the same as a car and... I went to shift gears and something just stuck. I look down to see this red goop not letting me shift gears. I look down to see what the hell's the matter and the truck just jack-knifes and sends me sprawling. I've driven a rig for 26 years and I ain't never seen a liquid like this.”

“Hmm... red liquid...”

“You ok there?” the driver asked in concern.

“They don't know what's wrong with me yet. Some kind of internal infection I think. They've got me on antibiotics. So, you know a lot about history, or just Civil War history?”

“Just Civil War really. I feel asleep in my own history classes. But the Civil War, that's different. It's something I can put my hands on. There's memorials all over the country. There's people's great granddaddy that fought. They've got live replicas in museums. Ain't just some paragraphs in a book.”

“Yeah, it's like that in Greece. I know Greek history, and I've visited. There's history everywhere.”

“Yeah, yeah exactly. I done hitchhiked everywhere I can imagine and there's still places I haven't seen. You know that time... it's the only time people couldn't work out their differences through democracy. Where people fought for something.

“I come from the South so...”

“The losers always remember the war longer than the winners?” Dr. Creed interrupted, not knowing why.

“You could say it that way and it twouldn't be wrong. My great granddaddy's farm got burned in General Sherman's march to the sea. So yeah the South, we remember. But it was the American crisis. That's what those damned fools don't understand. You wanna fly the Confederate flag and they say it's just plain racist. I don't fly the flag, because I think it divides people. We oughtn't have another Civil War, you know what I mean? It was brutal. Brother against brother.”

“Well there was no way to stop succession other than to destroy the other army. You lose one battle you can just retreat five miles and set up fort again.” Dr. Creed responded though it had been a long while since he'd read much on the topic.

“That's right, that's right. They didn't get General Lee out of Virginia until the very end. The battles came from every direction. The Yanks took control of the Mississippi, and split the Confederates that way. But they never drove forces out of Texas. It was the whole country fighting, state by state.

“The only time the country was truly lost. Is there gonna be freedom, or can we have slavery too? You can't have both now can ya? But when they answered the question, the factories in the North were prosperous, and the farms in the South were destroyed. So it's a touchy subject, ya know what I mean?”

“Yeah. When I get my strength up. Let me tell you about the Greek civil war.”

“Whoa, I kind of spouted my mouth of huh? Usually people moan and groan before I get finished talking.”

“Yeah, well... say, where were you taking your truck?”

“Party supplies. Old factory, you can generally tell by the kinds of rust in the less visible areas.”

“Why would a party supplier need liquid nitrogen? I guess I could expect dry ice, but not something so hazardous.”

“I've been driving hazardous waste trucks seven years, I don't want to tell you all the places I ended up. The only I check on nowadays is the facility. Rust, wear, and the like. Want my hazardous waste to be stored in my rig properly, know what I mean. But yeah, I thought it was a strange deal. Not the strangest I've seen but definitely odd.”

“What's the strangest you've seen?”

“Let's not talk about that.”

“Horrific?”

“I couldn't tell you.”

“Oh. That kind of strange.”

“Yeah.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Well, Dr. Creed,” the doctor looked over him, “your's is a most perplexing case. You're running a fever, have an elevated white blood cell count, and body wide inflammation. Your body is fighting something that's not responding to anti-biotics. The tests came back and we still can't locate the source of infection. But... you're in remarkable health for someone running your level of fever. I've never seen anything like it.”

“Am I going to get better? I've barely slept for four days.”

“You've remained pretty stable in your condition. I'd like to run a few more tests. There's a few more things to rule it.”

“Fine. More tests. I'm not going anywhere.”

“Mysterious illness just not leaving?” Dr. Creed's roommate asked.

“No.”

“Can't even figure out what it is?”

“No.”

“Well, the good Lord has His reasons for things, even if we can't fathom them at times. You need rest from something.”

“Um, it's complicated.”

“My bones won't set for two weeks.”

“Well... I'm a Greek professor. I know the language and the history. I've looked over the earliest texts in the Greek world. There's some writings that are older, but in my field of study they just stop. There's no way of knowing what went on before. At least, there's no language to record human thought. Does that bother you? Not knowing your origin?”

“I know my origin. Adam and Eve.”

“Yes...” Dr. Creed hadn't been prepared for that response. He was silent for a while. He didn't know if he had it in him to have a religious debate while internally cooking.

“Well?”

At least he asked. “How long were Adam and Eve in the garden being cast out?”

“I don't know. Doesn't the bible say?”

“I'm more knowledgeable about the New Testament. But I don't think it does. They could have been there five billion years, and that would be quite the different story than three days.”

“Well, what would it matter?”

“How long might it have taken the snake to trick Eve? It must have observed her first, no? Else how would it know what to argue? To tempt you have to know how to corrupt your target.”

“So the story doesn't give an indication of how prone we are to temptation. Does that bother you?”

“No. Ugghhh.... this fever doesn't go away.”

“Well don't strain yourself.”



“No I'm fine. Ok, history tells us the gospels were written forty year's after Jesus' death.”

“That's skipping around a bit, but true.”

“But Christianity is always trying to get to 'Jesus' teaching' or 'Christ's message'. You always lose something when you pass down a text. As a Christian doesn't it bother you not to have the direct words of Jesus?”

“You know you're not the first to make that point. I've heard a lot of people say that over the years. I just have faith that what needed to be passed down was written down. You gotta have faith.”

“What if you don't have faith?”

“I don't know what to tell you, other than I hope you find the Lord.”

“But I mean this is time before Christ, outside the lands of the Bible, you can't work with faith. You have to have documents.”

“Ok, I can see that. And there's only so far back the documents go, and so only so far back we can know history? Why's that bother you? There's plenty of history right here in the states.”

“Well imagine studying the civil war if there was a surviving copy of the Constitution.”

“That'd be different.”

“Well, that's what you work with in Greek history. There are texts you know existed because they're mentioned in stuff that survived, and all you would need to do is find that one copy, hidden in the bowels of the earth and your whole conceptions of things would change.”

“You think you're going to actually find these documents? They're B.C. after all.”

“Well what if I did find them, and couldn't prove it?”

“Well, I guess you'll be dismissed by the same kind of people that don't believe the Bible because it wasn't written by Jesus.”

“You've got a point.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“So this uh... Greek civil war, what was it like?”

“The Pelopenesian War... the great battle of the ancients. A nation of warriors, the Spartans, apower of agricultural wealth and slave labor.”

“The South.”

“Against Athens, the rising naval power and center of inquiry.”

“The North.”

“There were similiarities. But the power balance was more evenly matched and so it was longer.”

“And without guns.”

“Yes...” Dr. Creed replied, paniting a bit. The fever seemed on the increase. But rules of engagement were often the same.”

“How so?”

“Well...” Dr. Creed trailed off. “”Do you smell that?”

“Smell what?”

“Corpses...”

“Dr. Creed.”

“As brutal as battle gets, the death comes from disease.”

“Large group. Small space.”

“Precisely.”

“Sparta had Athens and a plague broke out.”

“What kind of plague?”

“Water.”

“Nurse! Nurse! We need some water.”

“The Plague of Athens. It was an internal fever that no water could cool. People...”

“Like the fever you've got?”

“Like the fever...” Dr. Creed felt his vision growing red. First in circles around the center. Then the center. Then nothing.

He opneed his eyes to find himself a top a dirty rag. A haggard woman was giving him water slwly, with an aged wooden spoon.

“Drink,” he heard and flinched. He recognized the word, but it wasn't English.

“You must drink. The sickness won't last. The gods cannot accost Athena forever.”

“Where am I?”

“Your aunt's. The temple is not far away, but I think you oughtn't go inside. Too many sick.”

“The temple? What temple?”

“Athena's temple. You're in Athens. You remember that?”

“More water.” Dr. Creed asked, dodging the issue. This wasn't what he had in mind when he wanted to return to Greece.”

The woman spooned a little more.

“There's not much. Fortunes have been ruined for water.”

“Need water.” Dr. Creed somehow scrambled to his feet, delirious. He wanted immersio nin water, even if he drowned.

“You need your rest nephew!” the woman exclaimed.

Dr. Creed lumbered over a circle of people surrounding a well, unable to focus on anything else. He restrained himself from jumping into the well but without seming control he seized a bucket to tip and coat himself with glistening water. But there was no water. A red sludge deluged him, seeming to seep in his skin and choke him. He gasped for air and woke up.

He was back in his hospital bed. The injured trucker was gone and the heat less oppressive. He looked around and noticed he was in a different room and everything was completely silent. No subdued steps of the nurses. No occasional roommate conversation wafting down the halls.

He looked up and over, and the IV with antibiotics remained and his eyes trailed down the tubing until he saw where it entered his arm, which he hadn't noticed until he saw it.

He again pushed a button to call a nurse. He looked around his room again and it seemed to be nothing but white cotton and clear plastic. Not a hue of cloor remained though a veteran television did remain mounted seven feet above the ground, or few feet past the edge of his bed, thouh it caught the light as if plastic wrapped.

The nurse took considerable time to arrive, and appeared as if dressed for surgery, hair in cap, mask, disposable glass and gown.

“Where am I?”

“You're in the isolation ward. I'm glad you've come to. I've never come across such a high fever. None of the doctors here have either. You didn't respond to antibiotics it seems. You must have a virus.”

“What kind of virus?”

“We don't know. Given the height of the fever we checked other hospitals to see if others displayed your symptoms. Checked the CDC as well. The doctors going to want to ask you some questions. You might be asked a lot of questions, so think about this. Have you done any international travel? Perhaps consumed an unusual imported good? Or just come across something for another country?”

“Not really. I drink imported Greek wine, but I've consumed it many times before without illness.”

“Is there anything else?”

“There isn't anything in Hades I can think of,” Dr. Creed turned his head and looked into his eyes, looking for some glimmer of understanding.”

“I've some forms that might dash your memory, and some paper and pen for journaling. Just write what's happened to you the few days before you got to the hospital. It may come to you. I shall tell the doctor you're awake.”

Dr. Creed sensed there was nothing he could do to explain the things that might have ailed him. He had the distinct impression his ordeal didn't start from the consumption of imported spinach. But he didn't see the harm in letting the doctor rule out suspicion given what little else he had to do.

“Maybe if I had a newspaper.” Dr Creed added, as if in afterthought.

“I would see how that might help.” In a minute and a half there was a newspaper in his bed. The headline for that paper was the pile up, the nitrogen truck overturning, the truck driver having been in the hospital in critical condition.

It confirmed the trucker's story with only minor inconsistencies with just one problem. It was today's paper.

After reading the article he called the nurse.

“Yes?” he asked, “You remember anything?”

“This accident in the front headlines. Didn't it happen a few days ago?”

“No. This was last night.”

“Because I remember having this trucker as a roommate for a few days. He was admitted to the hospital.”

“I can't really talk about other patients. But you've been in isolation. The trucker may have needed procedures. Sterile procedures. We wouldn't put you two in the same room.

“I remember him quite distinctly..”

“You haven't been in full control of your senses. Perhaps it was a dream?”

“Perhaps. If I read anything else unusual can I call and talk to you about it?”

“The night shift can be slow some nights. Just don't call me frivolously. I have to sterilize for every visit. It's a pain.”

“Understood.” Dr. Creed responded. It seemed now there were two realities going on for him at once. In one reality he was an overworked academic suffering an unusual illness most likely brought on by the weather and exhaustion. In another ancient texts appeared from nowhere, he could talk to people he'd never met, have viruses of the past, and kept encountering some strange red stickiness.

Perhaps this new world might be an interesting change of pace, except it didn't seem he could keep them separate, or know which one he faced at any given time. He wondered if there might be some strick, the way people identify that they're dreaming.

He wondered what those tricks might be but by then the doctor had come to interivew him. She talked with him at some length about the previous few weeks. Trying to consider what might have made him sick. It seemed like he had some sort of swine flu or entirely new disease, because no doctor he'd met had ever been so probing. He tried to give her as many mundane riddles to her as he could, because he was convinced the sickness was related to the ancient texts. Texts that shouldn't exist and which he could never pin the illness on.

“Alright,” she finally said in impatience. “I'll put this as simple as possible. I feel like you are hiding something. This is strictly confidential. What you say won't be held against you unless you're an imminent threat to yourself or others. Drugs?”

“No. Look, maybe my University was doing some medical research. I come into contact with a lot of students.”

“None of whom are sick. The hospital contacted the university.”

“Maybe it's a study you're not supposed to know about.”

“Military bioweapons research in a state university? I think not doctor.”

“What do you want from me?”

“The truth.”

“I've told you everything I know.”

“Well, you're going to be quarantined, perhaps for a while. If you happen to think of anything, take this.” It was a small device with a single red button. “You contact me directly.”

“Thank you Dr. ...”

“Reyes.”

“Thank you.”
