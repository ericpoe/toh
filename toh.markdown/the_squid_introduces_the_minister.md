Synopsis: Creed faces his most feared villain yet. This is the character which knows the protagonist best, who is best in a position to make him suffer. He sends Creed back into his greatest fear, that his small town existence was all there was to life. This is revealed a test before Creed is given his next ticket to the next film.
-->

Dr. Creed let his minds drift from the words of the King James Bible that the Blood of Apollo had allowed him to see. Its remaining prophetic power was likely in serious decline. He left his seat to check the door, and it was indeed locked. He checked the room for something to pick the lock, only to discover the remaining drawers and cabinets were also locked. He shivered to imagine what lay behind them. 

As he was yanking at the cabinets, he heard the door open. Creed looked around his shoulder, tired to get an additional glimpse from the lasts traces of his concoction. He saw the outline of a figure enter, something not quite human. Its silence and solemnity did not suggest it was a prophetic character.

As it stepped into the light he could see a rubbery creature with tentacles protruding from its head. Its mouth, hidden away, appeared as a circle, as if the jaw holding it shut could move the mouth in two directions rather than one. A small dab of pungent liquid metal hung about its face, what appeared to be the remains of a manowar of the type Creed was quite familiar.

"Who are you?" Creed asked.

"Hmm..." the creature said interested. "Funny you should ask my name before asking me what I am. But, as with both us, you are no ordinary person."

"What am I doing here?"

"HADES, the thing which you seem so keen to understand, is a in many ways a fragmented and disparate thing. You have been brought here by a most crude enemy, the military. A military which suspects you may possess a weapon of some kind, and will let nothing stand in its way, except the orders of a superior officer."

"A weapon?"

"Tickets to the Theatre of HADES are not doled out randomly and without care. Of course, their release is generally confidential. But it has not escaped notice that you have glimpsed four separate films in four separate theatres. It strains credulity that any official in the HADES organization would have granted you that much access and that you may have gained unauthorized access to the system. Who knows what you may have learned, or what threat you may pose?"

Water spilt out of the creatures mouth as it spoke, yet everything was spoken in an even meter. It's voice seemed that of a preacher who, winding through a long sermon, reaches the bible verse that inspired it and seeks to sear the quote in the audience's memory. 

"A threat to who exactly, or to what?" Creed asked.

"If you'll indulge your imagination for a moment, enriched as it's been by several enigmatic films, you should be able to draw to your mind every motivation for which one would wish to keep a secret and then imagine that there are individuals in HADES which possess that motivation. Not your secret perhaps, but someone's." 

"Then the Blood of Apollo was an interrogation technique?" Creed marveled.

"An obscure and sinister one. The blood of Apollo reveals, in symbolic terms, a conflict of particular importance to the drinker. To have someone drink it and listen to the babble that follows can prove particularly effective if the drinker cannot put into words his concern, for that kind of information cannot be extracted even through the most refined methods of torture. Of course, giving the Blood of Apollo to someone in fear for their life can produce the effect of having the victim a glimpse of their own demise. This would cause a great deal of self doubt regarding all the drinker's future choices, neutralizing them."

"So why was it given to me?"

"I did not ask." The creature replied.

"But surely you outrank any previous interrogator," Creed asserted.

"Yes, quite right," the creature twirled a tentacle in a long taloned finger. The motion resembled a girl playing with her hair, and was grotesque in it's being so out of place. "I take it you gleamed that by the order that figures have come to see you?"

"Particularly that they've been interrupted," Creed noted.

"Ah, yes. But outrank is a rather crude and rather human term for the relationship. Surely an organization of death might take on the hierarchical characteristics of a human military, a human endeavor that has caused so much death. But in this instance, I am the 'ranking' officer because I know you best." The creature's look was blank and implacable.

"What?" Creed asked?

"Yes, quite familiar with the sullen and bookish Jonathon Creed. Familiar with the boy who resisted his religious schooling not because his brain was developed enough to call forth reasoned argument against it, but because it made him feel lonely. Yes, lonely during his many catechisms because they required his memorization, not his input. Lonely during sermons he did not feel bold enough to ask questions of his minister. Lonely because his favorite books in the library were never a topic of bible study. Yes. Yes. All quite familiar that your misgivings about your religious background were emotional in origin, and that your now well thought out and reasoned objections were afterthoughts of a much older rejection before your adolescence.

"Familiar, I am as well," the creature continued, "of your many days in the town's small public library. A small two room affair you visited often, and with a mixture of comfort and guilty pleasure. I know the pleasure you experienced reading there. I remember the silence, the appreciation that you would not be disturbed, and your growing realization that a book allowed you a rich opportunity to explore another's mind. I remember when you flicked open your first page of the few Greek classics in that place, how you persisted in reading them despite their difficulty at your age, and how you discovered a world older than Christianity that no one spoke of.

"No one, of course," the creature hastened to add, "except your uncle, who had some background in the classics, and whom you idealized for that reason. From him, or more appropriately, from the man you imagined him to be, you saw a life away from that little town where it seemed your heart and mind were living on a battlefield rather than in a school or a home. 

"Most of all I am aware that the dream-like quality of your existence all these long months. Far more aware than you have been, of the fact..." The creature paused for dramatic effect, "that the reason for it all is because you are still asleep in Mrs. Ogden's rather tedious American history class."

Dr. Creed, if he could still be called that, woke with a start after something thumped quite close to has head. Getting up cautiously, he indeed saw himself in Mrs. Ogden's tedious history lessons. "Is there something you'd like to add?" she asked sternly.

"Something to... add?" Creed asked.

"Yes, dear Jonny. I'm sure we'd find your dreams most illuminating."

The irony made him smile, though he did not find the message particularly cheerful.

"What's so funny?" she demanded. "This is really quite the last student I would have expected this kind of behavior from. I thought you were taking notes."

There was still a pencil attached to his hand, but as he looked at the papers below, his eyes couldn't quite make out the writing. He tried to remember at what point in school he had fallen asleep in class, what he had done last time, until he stumbled and wondered if there had really been a last time. His notes were obscured, ink stained his white button up shirt, and he could only make out the word, "Milton" until he felt compelled to face Mrs. Ogden. 

"I'm sorry," he said. "I don't have anything to say for myself." He felt it best to get it over with. He didn't imagine a principal as stern or terrifying as the humanoid squid creature from his interrupted dream. 

"Yes, well." Mrs. Ogden responded and prepared to launch into a lecture only to be deflected by Jonathon's tactic of just admitting guilt and waiting for punishment. "I believe then your trip to the principal will be short," she responded and sent him out of the room.

He left, quite disoriented. He knew the exact pathway to the principal's office, but he had great difficulty remembering what he had been writing about. He felt certain he had been focusing so intently on jotting some notes to himself that he had tired from the effort. He suspected he had stopped paying attention to Mrs. Ogden for a considerable time before she noticed, perhaps from snoring, that he had left the room. 

"Milton." he uttered to himself. "John Milton? Author of Paradise Lost?" he continued his astonished whisper. He was quite familiar with Milton's work, the man who gave voice to the devil, not in rasping serpent calls but in poetry. He could not at this moment tell if his familiarity with the work was the result of his college education or the result of his having recently read it. 

He strolled casually down to Anthony Boggs' office. He was certain, certain his lack of caring for the consequences of his falling asleep was a sign that his adult self was simply unresponsive to teenage punishments. He'd had dreams like this too. Dreams where he went to school and just keep getting in trouble, completely apathetic and unable to help himself, only to wake up and realize summer was almost over. 

He entered the principal's office to see only Mrs. Fencington there, a bubble headed girl in her early twenties that no one could call anything except Amy. It was imagined that the true attraction for Mr. Boggs to be principal of the school was the ability to hire a young secretary he could boss around and perhaps carry on affairs with. Rumors did fly around with some frequency, but nobody was prepared to provide an eyewitness account of their own making to support it. Amy was neglecting Mr. Boggs presence, checking her lipstick and not really registering Creed.

"Here to see Boggs," he announced, she glanced up. 

"What for?" she asked. "He's out to lunch."

"I was caught sleeping in class."

"Oh," she stumbled, now fumbling about her bag for eye shadow. It felt obvious she was not doing any work but preparing for a date, and perhaps not with the principal. "Well then," she calmly opened the second drawer of the principal's desk and pulled out the pad he used to write detentions. Putting on eye shadow with her left hand while writing with a note with the right she said, "Detention after school," calmly. He wondered if she would bother making a record of it, or whether he could skip it. 

He'd never liked Amy. He'd never seen her pay the slightest attention to anything, and when she met him she always seemed more interested in herself reflected in the mirror than anyone else in the room. He wondered, exactly what God would have wasted such a beautiful a body on such an air-headed vanity. 

Not that he'd ever really voiced these thoughts to anyone, least of all his father, who was friends with Principal Boggs and who went to church together. No one in town was not suspicious of the many hours that Boggs and Amy had alone as a result of their employment. But no proof had been provided. As thoughtless as Amy seemed she still apparently had some degree of discretion, at least about people whose opinions she cared about, did not include Creed.

He knew he had secretly wondered if his father would have a row with his friend Boggs had he been discovered sleeping with his secretary the way his father argued with his uncle when it became known he had slept with one of his college students. The woman in question was, by his Uncle's account, an ex-student, a detail conveniently omitted by his father any time circumstances brought up the subject. A sin unforgivable for one to commit but completely acceptable for another, based on who that particular person was. The idea that God would give humans a set of rules and guidelines to follow that they could then apply at their convenience stunk a great deal, and it was infuriating that no one seemed to notice. At least no one discussed the subject.

It occurred to Creed though, looking down at Amy who was still seated at her desk, that he hated vanity in her more than other girls he had met because of the seeming hypocrisy of his father. Maybe this brief time in the principal's office alone with her might be a time to set a few things straight. Yes, he would look at her straight in the face and ask her something, he resolved. But she was looking in the mirror again, and he found himself looking down her shirt which was now the part of her in direct line of sight.

"Doesn't it get boring writing detentions?" Creed asked.

"Hmm..."

"You've been here what three years, four?" Creed continued. "Doesn't it get boring watching a new round of students breaking the same old rules?"

"Well, for stupid stuff. Insubordination, though, that's fun to watch. Watching Anthony's smug retorts is just about as much fun as watching him get purple in the face for a good smart ass."

Creed had been hoping that maybe that feeling of banality he'd had disciplining students as a professor might be shared by Amy, no matter how low his opinion of her. But it was apparently all a joke to her. Was there nothing in this woman, no ambition, no belief that there was a fate any better than being a petty servant of a petty tyrant?

"Better to be a master of hell than a slave in heaven." he mumbled. As he said them it hadn't occurred to him why or where they had come from, but he soon identified them as Milton's. 

"Hmm?" Amy asked. It seemed she hadn't heard a word, which was all the better, because he realized it was an invective against her boss. 

"Nothing, I'll go back to class and stay after school." Creed walked straight back to his class, hoping not to be noticed deep in thoughts not about the events surrounding his founding fathers, but trying to remember the particular importance the he seemed to attach to Milton. It did not surprise him that his unblinking expression would be less and less obvious to each passing teacher, as the day dragged on and the tedium continued. 

The puzzle vexed him long after normal school hours were ended, and his complete lack of outside initiative was appreciated by detention's observant Mr. Henson, who simply wished to get paid to read this particular outing. It wrestled with his curiosity he thought, not based in some particular passage in his book, but his approach to telling the story to begin with. 

In his ten years worth of religious education, it seemed no biblical passage or religious discussion had ever truly sought out the motives of its main antagonist, Satan. Milton had offered the explanation of pride, not in a contemptuous morality tale, but in verse. The approach, fascinating in his own right and capturing his imagination in its own way, was not nearly as exciting as a premise that must have guided the poet's hand through many a sleepless night, that Satan's story had not been adequately described and expressed in the Bible.

He had been portrayed as a sleepless malice. Always imagining woe, calamity, the undoing of God's will, and above all, the erosion of faith. Yes faith. That thing which you had to proclaim each day, with a grinding repetition, in every thought and prayer. That thing above all else that Minister O'Connor, emphasized was a necessity. The thing that Satan was lapping his lips to receive with great delicacy that moment when you merely wondered if it was all rubbish and was ready to claim you as his prize the moment your thoughts should turn astray. What kind of creature was **that**? 

And what sort of God thrust his creations into a world of sin and ignorance without any evidence of his presence, and punish, forever, those who couldn't work it out that he existed anyway? Perhaps, as Milton had done before, he ought to retell the story of their creation and the nature of their feud and see if any wisdom came out of it. He did not know precisely how to cast them, but he decided, right before the end of the detention, that the one thing that would satisfy his story telling ambitions that any character ingenious and subtle in his schemes was subtle and ingenious in his ultimate goal. There would be no unrelenting and unthinking enemies of faith. In this new creation story he imagined, the master of doubt would have a reason for his treachery, an end goal in rounding up the doubters and keeping them forever out of God's graces. 

At first, he should have to separate doubt from faith, and should have to do it without attracting his father's attention. On most days a few religious pleasantries and a quiet tongue would have been enough. His father was simple man after all. His old dream suggested that he was not quite as dense as he imagined him to be as a teenager. Then he remembered he was a teenager, and wondered how that dream in American History should seem so vivid when the memory of a dream generally didn't survive the end of a day. 

In any case, he was here now, and had a current purpose. He received a ride home from one of the football team's linesman in exchange for copied homework, who also noticed his apparent woeful and distant expression.

"Oh, relax," he said, "just a detention." The boy seemed to have attributed it all to school boy regret. "I wished I could get in a few more naps in Mrs. Ogden's classes."

"You ever wonder why we've got to get up and go to a school that never teaches us anything, with teachers that can't teach and students that can't learn, only to arrive in our homes and not want to go to sleep?" Creed asked.

"Well, yeah. Now that you mention it. But if you think so badly of it, why do you get good grades?" The linesman asked.

"Keeps the attention away from you."

"You said try football heh? It's more fun. Don't know if you have the body for it, but I've never seen you try, Jonny."

"Thanks." 

You just remember that on my algebra homework, got it?" the lineman added.

Creed stepped out the door with a meek, "No prob." It was pathetic, how was is it all a sudden he couldn't keep anything internal? How was he to deal with the more active attentions of a father when he couldn't ignore a secretary or a football player? Upon arriving at his front door, he decided to feign a headache. He opened the door, his father reading the paper, his mother in the kitchen, holding his head and not quite looking where he was going.

"You all right?" Jonathon's mother asked.

"Fine mom. Head just hurts." He leered about and walked rather slowly, going overboard because he hadn't the energy to be subtle. The change in demeanor was readily noticed not to his favor. He had probably gotten out of having to explain his feelings at the present moment, but failure to set forward this story in his mind was leave some explaining to do later. "Think I'll go to bed."

"Jonny!" she cried.

"I'll be fine," Creed reassured.

His father looked up from the paper, and said a non-committal, "Be well my boy," as if he hadn't believed a word. Jonathon climbed the stairs to the room and locked the door shut behind him. He had worked out one thing. Doubt seemed a shameful thing, an attitude in your head and expressed in private. He had confessed misgivings to two strangers, to blank and reflexive positions. It seemed faith was something you were to broadcast to the world, and doubt kept secret. Creed was in full swing doubt mode now, to the point of fleeing from his household's maintainer of faith, and he was lamenting the thought that he would at some point have to proclaim "Yes! I believe, oh I believe!" and not be able to do it convincingly. 

Jonathon turned on his lamp and wrote, "God had a plan, a plan where everyone believed everything." He erased the phrase instantly, but which after many minutes he put back on the page. He had promised himself that he would not give such simplistic motives in neither God nor the devil, but this phrase seemed to inspire the antagonism he was looking for. Satan would of course had some anti-plan. It all seemed too simplistic, and he didn't even have an attractive name for this against planness that Satan would have. To undo a plan was... sabotage. That was the word, and he could refer to his character now not as Satan, loaded as it was, but the Saboteur. At least, he thought, he had somewhat interesting rivals. The Planner and the Saboteur. 

And God said, "Let this school have a secretary!" and the saboteur said, "Let her not have any brains!" and God said, "Let this school have a principal!" and the Saboteur said, "Who sleeps with the secretary!" He couldn't suppress a chuckle. It was not the work of literary genius. But Satan the Clown was certainly a more interesting character then the Prince of Darkness.

His mother knocked, and now he had to reassume a scowl as he unlocked the door and his mother offered him a dinner plate. 

"You looked so miserable," she told him.

"Thank you mom," Jonathon replied.

"You know it happens to everyone, at some point."

Jonathon had never heard tale of someone experiencing a dream of half a lifetime, nor a storytelling impulse to recast God and the Devil. Except for Milton, at least, and perhaps an unknown number of his readers.

Jonathon knew he should let her speak. Knew he should have let her voice her suspicions and wait to see if they were not better than the truth. Then he could have a lie told for him. But he could not hide a quizzical expression on his face. 

"You don't have a headache. You have a heartache. It's a girl. I'm a mother. I can tell."

"No, that's not it. I think I'll worry myself about girls in college." This was not entirely true. There was red haired Alice, but she had been two years ahead of him and quite hard to corner as she was so busy with band. But she was the only redhead in his school, and that characteristic had set her apart in his mind, led him to a fantasy of what she must be like that was hard to shake off. But that old desire had been put far in the back of his mind as he concluded she would never be his. The dream of his seemed to suggest his odds would increase in college, when he did remember a short fling in his junior year that resulted in a few consummations.

"Oh, yes, your ambition. You know, it would of course be more suitable to find a girl once at college, or in your profession, when your pathway to settling down was a little more clear. But the heart does not wait for things like ambitions. If there is someone now..." his mother said, traces of anticipation detectable.

"I'm not on the verge of a high school sweetheart mom. I've got to get some homework done. Thank you for the meal, I suppose I ought to be grateful for it before I'm off to college and on my own."

"I do my best."

Jonathon took his plate, and locked the door. He had had trouble keeping a thought just beneath the surface, a line from God to the Saboteur.

"If you think creation is so easy," God threw his hands up into the air, let me see what you would do." And no Jonathon had, on the end of his pencil, the Saboteur, the master of Doubt with the entirety of creation at his disposal. 

"I, he laughed, "would jumble everything up, you see. I would have their be Satan, the creator. I would have God the usurper, the destroyer, in charge. I would have them worship God and tell them he is their creator, and curse Satan as his adversary. I would tell them that God likes faith and Satan loves doubt, of course the exact opposite of the case. And of course none of my creations would actually be able to see God and the Devil, or know exactly what faith and doubt are in the first place. Then I'd get a good laugh, see, as no one could make sense of the world."

He couldn't believe he'd written it. Carried away from some stroke of inspiration, the song of a Muse that had reached his mind by some strange instrument. He saw the terror in the idea not seconds before the pen had finished touching the paper--that every truth he clung to was in fact its exact opposite, and it would be impossible to tell if their was a Saboteur whose plan it had been all along. 

Life was an experience. Faith was the insistence of a truth that could never be touched or altered by experience. He had set stock all this time in his loneliness, his attachment to his memories of happiness, his days consumed in the library. Had the Saboteur arranged it so all these activities were precisely the opposite of what he should be doing, keeping him from steeling his heart in Jesus via the illusion and experience? Terror struck him, and in that moment his father walked into his room. 

Rather than push the paper away as he entered, he decided to crack a book and make it look like notes. The obvious act of one to hide the less obvious act of writing so no embarrassing questions could be asked in this moment of panic. Now for the first time against an adversary to his story that could actually recognize his heretical purpose, he sought to draw his attention to a lesser crime.

"So I guess you worked out I was in detention today," he muttered. It became clear it was an unnecessary slip but hoped the shock would distract his father from what he came up to talk about it.

"Were you? I'd would have expected you at the library. Well, you'll have to tell me about it, later. I couldn't help but overhear you discussing college plans with your mother."

"Oh, yes well. I suppose I don't have any definite plans yet." This was half true. He did not quite know what he planned to do. He was perfectly clear on what he didn't plan to do, go to a religious college.

"I can certainly say I can see the attractions for you. I tried to make my way through seminary school which I'm sure you know all about. College certainly has a structure that I think you would find vastly superior to high school. There is a great deal of time for private study, to personally select those subjects which you find most interesting. But then of course, there is the issue of money, which halted my progress, as did a family."

He seemed to remember getting through school. Images poured back of fast food jobs, camp counseling, solicitations of alumni over the telephone, and a mound of student debt that only disappeared after years of being an adjunct professor and doing odd jobs on television programs. It was hard not for his mind to wander towards someone whose means could certainly keep enough money in his pockets to keep him from being penniless.

"I have told you a few times that my savings would not be sufficient. Only a few times, hoping it should instead inspire you to seek scholarships rather than discourage you. But there is a member of the family that does, and I must warn you not to yield to the temptation to seek funds from your licentious uncle. He will of course try to advise you into a field of study that would be most unhealthy. I do not doubt my brother to spare any expense to see his brother's son follow in his footsteps for spite alone."

"I've barely met my uncle," Creed protested.

"Yes, this is true. And I count myself a fine father for keeping you away from the temptations which I am sure he will offer you. Of my three boys I have always noted so many inclinations in you that remind me of him. He too, as a boy, showed a tremendous capacity for reading. I read a great deal, of course, but for a certain pleasure. I have noticed in you a capacity for continuing to read books far beyond your grade level, books that you must have understood only vaguely, no matter what difficulty they presented you. I have noticed too, wild jumps in your preference for fiction and nonfiction, and a dozen other things it would be too tedious to mention."

Jonathon did not particularly like his father's intimate knowledge of his reading preferences, a subject into which he had never launched before. Nor did it endear him to his father that he was proud of denying him a relationship with his Uncle that he at times desperately wanted, feeling his friendship would nullify the isolation he felt amongst his peers. 

"I have always boggled," Jonathon told his father, "that one brother should turn out wrong and the other right. Does not Jesus tell the tale of the prodigal son?"

The brow of the Elder Creed furrowed. It was happy, he could see, of a ready application of a biblical parable by his son in the service of hope. He replied, however, "Yes, it does. I am happy to hear you remember it, for a parable is useless if it cannot be readily recalled and applied in our own lives. This, if I may sidestep the issue a little, is why I've always seen your religious education of utmost importance. But I fear the application of that parable to this circumstance would be disastrous. I know my brother very well, and whilst the prodigal son returns of his own free will, I do believe your uncle would only return over his own dead body.

"I think, if you are looking for a successful college student to emulate, it should be Rev. Lee, the only preacher in town to have successfully made it through seminary school. He should be able to best guide you, and I do think I can arrange it meet with him at some private hour. He should be best able to prepare you for the challenges of the road your heart so greatly prizes."

Great. Could this day possibly get any worse? Underneath his American history textbook, the beginning of all this mess in the first place, was a fictitious story enough to be burned at the stake in elder times. He was then to see a preacher, at the very moment his face, expression, and inclinations were not under his sufficient control to allow for privacy?

The meeting was scheduled for Saturday, and the school days that followed did nothing to enhance his spirits. There was both to consider that he'd gotten every last thing about life wrong while at the same time lured by the possibility that every teacher and class had done likewise. History was of course the worst, filled as it was with stories that could be subverted at every turn. The Americans were tyrants and the British were liberators. Or, depending on the year, the colonists whining ingrates not willing to pay their share in the protection the British provided them from the French, that the Boston Tea Party had actually proceeded like a drunken Super Bowel party rather than an expression of rights... it was too easy, for every subject really, but history being the worst.

Creed decided that he could not halt the spread of this contagion of his ideas. He'd seen how feeble the attempt had been all week. His mother and father both offering to help at the moment he wanted them out of his sight slowly wore at him until at least he decided, recklessly he knew, to bring his sheet of paper to Reverend Lee and read it aloud. 

But as he looked up at the copy it seemed he had not built the climax up properly. He wanted, he wanted the initial portion to come off as a queer religious joke, until it crescendoed into something uncomfortable and then to its diabolical content. Over the week he refined it with fragments of thoughts throughout the day. 

Then three days of fighting with his own brain, about the limits of his idea, about the length and content of his essay, of how to hide his sleep deprivation and his obvious stress, he was there. He was about ten minutes late, owing to his mother insisting on a certain level of personal hygiene so as to make a good impression. Not that the emphasis was so needed; he had known Reverend Lee for years.

"Greetings," he said expectantly, from inside his study, which was not seen too often by outsiders. His library was slightly bigger than his own public library. The perks he supposed, from a generous congregation. "Your father," he asked, "explains you've an interest in becoming a minister."

"Going through seminary school, sir. Well, actually just college," Creed corrected.

"I see. Your father quite convinced me it was seminary school your were interested in. It is maybe, his wish rather than yours? I know both that he never completed it and it is a great sorrow for him. But I must warn you that entering seminary school without feeling called to preach the gospel would be a terrible mistake."

"It would?" Creed asked in surprise.

"For two thousand years man has been searching himself for the meaning behind Christ's miracles and parables. The scholarly commentary is immense, and I cannot imagine spending sleepless nights reading arguments on Christ that strike you as absurd unless you could be certain there was a flock waiting for you when you returned. And this is in full well knowing that in Protestant tradition no one is required to choose a specific preacher at all. You must write sermons that have people coming back."

Creed felt a little guilty for having hatched this plan, and apprehensive. It seemed probable that Rev. Lee had, over the years, heard many arguments against his faith and rejected them all. However, it was just such a figure that was worth it. He had expressed less refined thoughts to people far less prepared to his observations.

"On the subject of writing sir. I believe I will have to do a great deal of it," Creed declared.

"Yes."

"I've been working on something. A sort of, um... Divide Comedy."

"Dante?" he asked curiously.

"What?" Creed asked.

"Hmm... you are not familiar. This is a phrase unborrowed I see."

"Oh, well yes. You see it comes to this. God and the devil are in eternal argument," Creed began the story.

"Yes."

"So, I imagine a time before the argument was so vicious, a time when they worked together as bickering coworkers of creation."

"Interesting," Lee looked with cautious interest.

"A passage. And God said, let their be cars, for man to better traverse and understand the scale of my creation. And Satan said, let there be stop signs, so that he does not enjoy it! May there be a front seat, for which the view is far and wide. May there be a back seat, so that there should be a place to sin!" 

Lee laughed. "Quite the imagination. Sorry to interrupt." I contained for several refrains, watching him smile, and then sprung on him the surprise of real people, Amy and Principal Boggs. His laugh was both explosive and short. He had caught the reference, and was quite uncomfortable, though not enough to interrupt.

"And then of course God gets a little tired that every so called contribution of Satan is actually a subversion of his own vision, and says, "Well if you think creation is so easy, why don't you tell me how you'd do it?" Creed then went into great deal his inversion scheme. Rev. Lee's eyes widened in shock, for he could not believe what he was hearing. When Creed's performance was over however, Lee had straightened up, and showed his mettle.

"I believe you have grasped the concept of a Prince of Lies more eloquently than I have ever heard, and I've read many religious writers."

"Well, sir, it did occur to me that if the Devil had been successful in this plan, there would be no way of knowing it."

"You are indeed right. I see you have stumbled into a line of thinking about Christ quite outside your Protestant background. As a Protestant minister you would not hear me give a sermon on the matter of course, but as we are discussing a matter in private I think I can go into some detail. The idea of life as an illusion was something that greatly concerned many mystics. Man, has, as you know, fallen from the grace of God. Since God alone is truth, that suggests man's existence is lies. If man's existence is lies, religion would not be exempt. It is a perilous line of thought, I think. But one which can be firmly resolved. If all of man's surroundings are lies, he is to purify his heart, inside himself, until he can experience God the truth directly, outside the illusions of his shadowy existence. But the truth of God is faith, and the quest for purity is to fail for man is sinful by nature."

Color had greatly returned to Lee's face, though he seemed distant. "If you are capable of spotting such a great dilemma at your age, with only a small town religious school education as a start, you would certainly do well in seminary."

"But I still don't quite understand. As presented in my story, Satan makes humans incapable of knowing exactly what faith really is," Creed felt adamant in his literary flourish, and returned to his complication.

"Faith is..." And Lee stumbled. "Knowing something in your heart that it is true," he looked over at Creed, imploringly. 

"But I don't believe that. I believe..."

"What do you believe?" Lee asked imploringly. "For belief is an act of faith!"

"I believe defining man as sinful from the outset, as something imperfect to be judged, denies man his very essence, his experiences. They are not to be looked at solely through the eyes of inevitable temptation and sin. They are to be lived, to be loved and hated, to illuminate and cloud his vision, to be his own, his life, which by all the evidence he's ever given, is the only one he really knows. It does not matter if they are fact or fiction, dream or substance, as long as they make up... a life."

Creed was panting no, breathless. He'd been caught up in his words so much as to not notice his surroundings, which seemed inexplicably different. He had been standing before, as if giving a performance, now he was lying down. The first explanation he could grab was that Lee had thrown a heavy book at him and knocked him unconscious. But the presence of the squid thing brought to his mind that he was still in the interrogation room. The thing watched him, slowly, probingly. 

Something had sent this monster after him, capable of it was of sending him directly into a primal, unexpressed fear. That all this his life really had been a dream. Perhaps he also feared psychosis as well, but it had sent him back to a terror far older than the mysterious Russian army and their guns. The fear that his small town existence was inescapable, and would come to define his life. 

What in all of HADES, would send him back in conflict with that moment? For there had never been that conversation with Reverend Lee. Never too that discussion with his mother about love, and he had long forgotten about Alice, but he still wanted her. At least, he wanted the triumph of seducing a woman out of his league, the chance to know her as a mate. But it was an adolescent wish easily quelled. He'd never really understood quite what made women choose their partners, what women wanted.

The thing still looked down at him, leaking. 

"What are you still doing here?" he demanded. "You didn't get out of me what you wanted."

"You are greatly mistaken, Dr. Creed. You have been authorized to receive tickets to another film. But you see, there is a complication. You are not to die before reaching the Theatre. These tickets must stay in the right hands, and you are being hunted. But it is not your will to die, is it? Not to fall into an eternal dream from which you cannot wake. I designed that dream. I was convinced you would be well on your way to HADES by now. Will you take the tickets? I am most interested to see your reaction."

"Of course I'll take the tickets," Creed bellowed. "Now get out of here."

"As you wish."
