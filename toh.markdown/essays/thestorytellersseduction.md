### The Storyteller's Seduction

"That movie isn't deep James. It isn't an allegory about biblical history, or the relationship of truth to power. It's a stock movie written so that Christians can feel good about their religion."

Thus went an argument between my roommate and I over a favorite movie of mine, The Book of Eli. To describe in brief, after a nuclear war, Eli, finds the only remaining copy of the Bible and takes a journey of 30 years to the remains of San Franscisco. His great enemy is a town leader named Carnegie, determined to use the Bible for his own nefarious purposes. It is the Western, set in an apocalyptic future, with a theological bent.

It is also a throwback to the days of the martyrs, in a somewhat familiar time and place, where a man is faced with such a rare occurrence in modern Western culture, being in the position of dying for one's faith. 

In short, everything necessary to relive the days of the martyrs, to experience the joy of knowing faith will always conquer temporal power is there. If you wanted a feel good movie about faith the Book of Eli will not disappoint.

There's just one problem. In the setup for the movie, its characters and events (especially the motivations of the "villian" Carnegie) lies every thorny question of Christianity, if only you're perceptive enough to see them. Is killing in the name of God ok? Because the main character Eli kills about 20 people on screen time alone (not to mention his thirty year hike) on his
noble quest. 

So, if I were to approach the creators of the screenplay, and the attitude of its creators was closer in mind to the more derisive comments of my roommate, and the subtle and thorny questions of religion hadn't really been much of a concern, how could I approach them? 

"Your movie isn't about the triumph of faith, are here's why. Remember that scene where x happens to y? Well, if faith triumphed why did this happen? In short, you may have intended to write a film about this subject, but you didn't. If you look at the film that was actually produced, it says this."

In short, I would be fighting the seduction of the author, the claim that they have the authority to determine a film's meaning, not the viewer. The seduction of the author is the claim they 
have exclusive rights to its meaning, which puts you in the position of the passive and seduced receiver of that meaning.

To avoid this passivity, one can keep the following points in mind. 

1. The only way to know what an author intended for any given passage is to actually ask the author. Any argument about what the work "really meant" that does not actually quote the author is an argument about what the work based on the work itself. 

2. It is the author's job to say what they mean. If they want a story to have a particular meaning, it's there job not to include passages that contradict their own purposes. An author shouldn't be able to claim, "But that's not what I meant!" if they can't marshall arguments from what they actually wrote.

3. Some rather sophisticated works use unreliable narrators. That is, the narrator's version of the events is so twisted and contradictory that the story becomes fragmented between what may have actually happened (in this fictional universe) and what the author recollects. The point here is that if one story can have an unreliable narrator, why can't any story have an unreliable narrator? 

It is a personal belief of mine as a storyteller that the best stories are those in which no seduction takes place. For this allows the reader to come back to the story and see something new in it each time. It is thus stories that stick in my mind most of all, those stories that really grip me and which I learn from the most. 

It is in my own work, my own novel, that I seek to write a story 
that is quite readable, that compels the reader, and yet never quite seduces them in a way that the story I wrote and the story they've read are quite the same.

### Fighting the storyteller's seduction, if you must

It's your favorite story. The one you can hear again and again without ever seeming to diminish its value, almost like an old friend. Then one day, the author spills the beans on their take on the story.

It turns out that science fiction movie about an intergalactic war was actually the War of 1812 in disguise. That touching film about an adventurous hippie was the author expressing their feelings on god, or the zany tale about excessive consumption of drugs was really about the American dream. But, but, it's your favorite tale, and now it's all ruined. Or is it?

The well crafted tale is hard to put down, has an addictive element to it. What happens in the end? What happens in the end? I have to know. The story teller is out to seduce you into a world
of their own devising. 

But when do you, as the reader, strike back? If you don't think a  story ended the way it should have ended, when do you get to have a say? When is the story yours to alter, if the author does not agree with your take on the work? Well, a few notes on the story teller's seduction.

1. The author's thoughts, motivations, and intentions and not necessarily readily apparent. Authors as a whole don't try to "hide" their meanings, but they may only make them implicit. You really can't anticipate what the author "really means" unless you directly ask them. 

2. It is the author's responsiblity to write what they mean. If you come away from a work with a greatly different experience of a work then the author did, the author has no right to say "But that's not what I meant", because it was their job to write what they meant.

3. To some degree "what the author meant" is irrelevant because more intricate stories often use unreliable narrators. If it's well enough to tell a story where the author isn't telling "the real story" but only their twisted, inconsistent take on the story, then why can't any story possess an unreliable narrator?


-----------------------------------------------------------
Tell a true story, as best you can, and you should hope that those who repeat it get it right. You wanted to relate things as they are to anyone who you'd like to know. What, however, comes of the tale that is labeled fiction from the very beginning? The story **never happened** and both story teller and listener know this. Is it important to tell this story the same way? Is it important neither embellish nor alter, in short never put into the work something the author had never intended? 

For a moment, pause to remember that the story is presupposed not to align with physical events in space and time. Should the tale remain in the same form as the author originally recorded it? Should the meaning derived from the work spring from what the author intended to say? An urge to say yes is to fall prey to the Seduction of the Storyteller

Let us begin with question with the common experience of the "so bad it's good" story. This is the story so poorly told that you
can't possibly enter its world on literal terms. So you inject it with your own references, tell jokes at crucial turning points in the plot, laugh at characters during their dramatic moments and decisions. 

Of particular note here is the B movie, watched amongst friends, whose value magnifies with every opportunity for a viewer to make a humorous remark, a snide comment, a pop culture reference. It's not the movie itself that is being enjoyed it is what is being put into the movie by its viewers that is being enjoyed. 

This is all well and good for a movie who's story isn't compelling, but what if the story is compelling?
