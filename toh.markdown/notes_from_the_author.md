### Notes from the Author

I understand that, given the breadth of a tale as fanciful as presented as the Theatre of Hades, a reader may be in some desire of some supplementary material from the author. I am willing to offer it, but only under the pretext that it's purpose is understood. For this I must begin with my personal feelings about the role of literature.

Many, in looking to a piece's meaning, search for what the author "really meant", and believe this interpretation to be the "right one". I am not under this persuasion. I do not believe I possess the exclusive rights to the meaning my readers might derive from the tale. This story is not a fable, and was deliberately left for the reader to interpret. If I'm intending to give free license for the reader derive meaning for themselves, I have reliquished control over the meaning of the tale to anyone that reads it. I don't own it, and have made my ownership legally clear by putting it under a creative commons license rather than copyright. 

Should the full autonomy of my reader to draw their own conclusions be understand, some supplementary material would, I think, add to the value of a tale such as this, which fragmentary and difficult to piece together.
