### The Ooze Explained

Dr. Creed shielded his eyes from the pouring rain, and felt his shoes sink into a thick molasses of mud. They were now splattered, and the mud was clinging to him, but still slowly drip down, a thick disgusting goo. The rain pelted it hard but still it stuck, like a an ink consuming waste product, a genetically engineered honey out of control, a black delicacy stuck to a desert flour, the corpse of a jellyfish not yet congealed. 

This wasn't the worst of it of course. Numerous pieces of intelligence suggested a building somewhere in the city, A building with a door that never opened, but whom only a few building maintenance staff found unusual but no one had reported. Being caught by a presumably Russian military and suspected himself a wanted criminal, there were really no way near that building, which might be guarded, but through the sewer. More muck. Damp, foul smelling muck. 

There hadn't been any reason for him to go through that sewer of course. He was still in the position to go home, still in the postion to tell Electra he hadn't found anything. But he hadn't quite his job, risked life and limb, doubted his sanity, nor left behind a must unexpected love interest to turn back, even if nothing but hardship or death remained when he reached out of the sewer and entered the door of that building. 

Never before had he truly understood the fate of the tragic heroes he so greatly remembered from his tales. How they continued to their terrible fate practically knowing it was coming, never turning behind to consider a normal life. How they madly followed their wretched circumstance until--and this was always true of the best tragedies--they missed that chance to turn back. It was because they had too much invested in their own course of action to turn back, and this too was clear now for it was the case with him.

### Persephone's Speech

"Clearly you are not a deity of the afterworld, someone who understands death beyond which a human has the capacity for understanding. It is easy for you, of course to know physical death, which all living things face, and it has crossed your minds of death as a metaphor, the death of a movement, the death of an idea, the death of an age. But things such as the death of reality or the death of time are still very much out of your grasp. 

"You see the world as an ant does, only perceiving those things which aid in your survival. You cannot see in the dark as so many nocturnal predators can, nor can you find your way through sound alone. Thus you cannot perceive when reality is about to die, though the vaguest notions of such occur amongst the best and brightest, the madmen and the prophets, that something new is being born from the corpse that is dying, as your world is. 

"But something new can only be borne from the seeds of what came before." Creed interjected.

Something of a strange smiled came about Persephone's face, toothless or one side and glinting white on the other.

"It is rare for me to encounter someone so perceptive. The Theatre of HADES, of course, was my idea, bound as I am to both the living and dead world as no other truly is. The seed of a new reality, is of course the imagination, and no where in the human imagination is their quite room for so expansive an act as fiction, something humans seem to prefer over this concept the have of truth. But that is another matter."

"These stories. I still have a ticket to the Theatre of HADES. Am I to watch something here?"

"That depends. What that film here and you'll never return. But that is where the Theatre for that ticket resides."

"So... I'm not in the underworld."

"Heavens not. You would of course, never return. This is a private study of mine, when I make preparations to return for the spring. It has been a long, long winter. What am I to do with this ticket?"

Persephone's look was stern and probing. Creed understood she wanted him to answer. 

"Give it to someone else."

"What makes you say this?" She asked amused. 

"I wonder if these tickets are designed to lead someone here, or some place just like it, and I've made it here without the aid of this film."

"Have you? Because I should imagine you would have never made to this place if it hadn't come into your possession in the first place. That you'd still be trying to decipher documents of a new reality waiting to be born, that briefly flickered into existence on your desk many months ago."

"Can I return to an age I desire," Creed asked.

"I told you time doesn't quite work the way anyone thinks it does. You may return to any age your desire of course, though it would be quite difficult to conceive of a reality in which you didn't. I wouldn't strain your brain trying to think of it. But if you wish to leave your existence behind forever, to travel the ages and see the film that ticket is for, you're more than welcome. It would be the more interesting choice."

"I've had enough interesting. the new life I see ahead of me is quite sufficient."
