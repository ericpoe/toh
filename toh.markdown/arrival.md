### The Ooze Explained

Dr. Creed shielded his eyes from the pouring rain, and felt his shoes sink into a thick molasses of mud. They were now splattered, and the mud was clinging to him, a slow drip down, a thick disgusting goo. The rain pelted it hard but still it stuck, like a an ink consuming confetti, a genetically engineered honey out of control, a black delicacy stuck to a desert flour, the corpse of a jellyfish not yet congealed. 

He continued to follow the path where that mysterious ooze grew thicker and thicker. Numerous pieces of intelligence suggested his destination to be a building somewhere in the city, a building with a door that never opened, which still did not seem to attract attention from anyone. After being caught by a presumably Russian military he suspected himself a wanted criminal and shuddered at the idea of approaching the place directly or moving in the open except under cover of darkness or rain. 

Keeping his head down so as to keep it more out of sight, he glimpsed something that startled him at first, but which seemed obvious in hindsight. He had crossed a sewer grate where the mud was coming up, not falling down, and determined that his path would now take him through the sewers. This prospect was revolting but the physical disgust he anticipated was offset by the comfort of being away from view. 

Creed darted towards an alley to plan on how to enter the sewers unnoticed, only to lose his balance. As he stumbled across the sidewalk his feet managed to look for balance on top of an unseen sewer grating, which collapsed at the slightest pressure and sent him sprawling into the sewers. He looked apprenhensively for a sign that he had been spotted, but the grating had apparently returned to its position and he had made no noise. The sewer contents must have sucked up any of the violence of his fall. This was clearly not human sewage. 

As Creed got to his feet he saw lights reflecting all about a river of faded images, somehow shimmering pink. The images, which never seemed to light up for a few seconds, were fully of religious images and symbolism. The popped in and out of existence with such variety and speed that he had really only been able to identify two religious traditions. Christianity, the religion which had come to him as a punisher in his childhood, and the pagan religion of the ancient Greeks, which had come to him in his studies, imagination, and adventures. 

Both had cropped up in the films of Hades, never quite possessing the characteristics he remembered to have outside the Theatre. Christianity had been used on him as a weapon. It had been a sort of blunt object that his father had used to keep him away from his uncle, oh whose temporal and secular success his father had been quite jealous. He had seen this weapon again in the character of Atticus Rex, the murderous preacher, but in the other Christian characters he had seen a streak of mysticism. And the scholarship he had always associated in the ancients had been quite the opposite in his vision of the incineration of Alexandria. 

As Creed continued the physical properties of the muck did not maintain themselves, one footstep leading to a splatter of water, another to a sinking sludge, another to firm ground. He began seeing his own face at times, at different times of his life. They increased in frequency as he quickened him pace until at last that pace had increased beyond his ability to remember his surroundings. When he slackened a bit for breath it became clear the supposed sewer system was bearing no resemblance to something that would be used to drain water from the streets. 

He shrugged and continued following the faces until he spotted a utility ladder on a spattered looking concrete wall. Upon closer inspection, however, it appeared as though the wall had been made of marble and the ladder, though man-made in shape, was a series of tightly wound vines. Eager to give this otherwordly drainage pipe a break he climbed out of the ground and discovered himself surrounded by a parabolical wall in which there was a curved door. A door it was likely no one would ever notice, as windowless concrete surrounded it a hundred feet high. 

The rain was coming softer now, and this time it did wash off everything that had clung on or caked to him. He noticed too, that the unsightly sore on his left shoulder had gone as well. His pocket, enamated a soft glow that seemed to be coming from his original ticket. Was this at last the Theatre which he had been offered a seat so long ago in his old university. Among the things striking him as strange was the continued discovery of a new ticket in which he wondered if he were not a guest at a theatre with a film for someone else. Where on earth was this ticket leading him. 

Staring at the featureless curved door a dread possibility occurred to him. These tickets were to places called Theatres of Hades. They were all small, emphemeral affairs. Shouldn't a Theatre of an underworld appear after death? Is that what lay behind this door? He thought for a moment of all his favorite Greek tragedies, filled with their tragic heroes. The most moving had all a single characteristic--the hero's demise was not inevitable. There had been choices away from that demise. But the hero, so determined by the weight of his choices and their consequences, had picked the end. 

These momentary reservations, however, did little to sway him. He too had the weight of choices to follow, even if they drove him away from a life he felt tempted to settle into, a life with Electra. He turned the large knob on the door and wrenched it open. It felt rusted shut, and the crackling of small broken bones echoed in the new place. 

The place reeked of pomegrenate juice mixed with a virulent strain of vinegar. A robed figure was seated, wrapped in study. Its backed turned, Creed could not get a good look at what it was studying, but it did not seem that it could possibly be a human book. 

"Dr. Creed," a voice hissed and bellowed. It echoed about the place, but with each reverberation it grew sweeter. He could see the figure wrenching, writhing, but twisting into a more human figure which, in the light, appeared female.

"I have a ticket."

"Yes, you do." The hissing had gone from the voice, yet it maintain that strange inflection of being harsh but shifting towards gentleness as time passed. It turned around and he could see something thick and vicscous running over a skeletal form, and he could swear it was human skin. Whatever it was that lay ahead of him, it seemed to be trying to take a human form to speak to him. 

Creed looked about in embarrassment. The walls were wending into a fabric of pomogrenate trees from which a few small fruits dangled.

"Pomogrenate?" The figure asked.

"If I understand properly eating pomogrenate comes at a price."

"A price?" The figure laughed, "Human language is so coarse at times. To compare eating pomogrenate seeds to concept involving money. But you use what words you have I suppose."

"Persephone!" Creed called out in wonderment.

The figure turned around, and he could know see a robed figure with a human face, though he suspected Persephone had not bothered to shed her dread aspect under her robe. 

"Yes," she smiled. "Forgive my study's ghastly appearance, I am still in transition to returning to the land of the living."

"It's summmer."

"Oh yes. It is an earthly summer. But surely a scholar in this age must have noticed that, quite far south, it is winter. That I drift back between the living and dead is not so simple as my famous story, when I predictably arrive at the same time, in spring."

"Hadn't thought of it from that angle. But how many people take that story literally anyway? I should only have to make an argument like that if I believe it concrete and temporal truth."

"You're quite right. Very perceptive. My ebb and return could never be adequately described by human language or the restrictions of a human narrative."

"So, you're set to make a return then. A big one."

"Yes, very much so. There has been a great deal of death, and I am beginning to gather the seeds of it for my return."

"What kind of death, exactly? Not biological death."

"No. It is not death of living things. It is a death of which I believe you are quite familiar, though not on a mass scale."

"Your growth time, you childhood I mean, was a lonesome, tedious, and isolating experience. Your heart felt a great deal of attraction to your scholarly uncle, which your father attempted to extinguish whenever he perceived it. You did not speak much, only during family occassions when your uncle's presence was unavoidable. 

"But from those rare occassions you formed an image of your uncle that you kept secretly in your mind. Your religious father could not help commenting on your uncle's secular inclinations, and so you imagined an uncle that derided religion as much as your father derided your uncle. Yet you were to be strictly religiously educated completely against your youthful inclinations."

"Your father rarely met your skeptical questions of his religion with calm and reasoned argument. Also your misgivings were met with some form of coercion, by a man whose response to a doubt of his faith was to rub out the doubter than answer his question. This inevitably lead your religious education to feel as an attempt to stamp out your intellect--to believe in a rigidly defined set of ideas and to never question their value. That of course is a kind of living death, which you have most obviously escaped." 

"Yes."

"Or so it would seem."

"Oh?"

"Never remind that remark. It was flippant. Your set of beliefs defines your reality. To enter into a set of beliefs which offers no ability to change with experience is to have a dead reality. To have a living reality is to be able to accept into your life that which you believe to be impossible, but which happens anyway. A lost scroll, a Theatre of HADES with satellites across the globe, an adventurous life for a tedious professor, and perhaps most impossible of all, the seduction of a beautiful woman by a man with so little natural aptitude for relations with the opposite sex. 

Creed felt his ego sucker punched but found himself chuckling anyway. His own laughter surprised him a bit, gave him a feeling of reckless swagger he responded, "If I've so little aptitude, why I have I got the prize? How many number of failed pairing really matter when I've got the one I really wanted?"

"Certainly true." the Goddess added with mirth.

"And I made it to your..."

"My study. If you need a name for it, and quite early I might add, or I might not have bothered with explanations."

"But why me in the first place? Why give the ticket to me in the first place? Is there something you're planning to have me do?"

"Understand. The birth and death of reality are not things one can change. One can only hope to alter their course in whatever way seems best."

"Like you?" Creed asked.

"Continue."

"Captured in your youth by your uncle, secreted away, your fate argued about by your mother, father and other uncle. A mother so enraged as to scourge the very earth she loved, and an uncle to persist in it this starvation for three years, as you yourself persisted. Those pomogrenate seeds you ate in all the stories... I have never been able to resolve this to my satisfaction, were you really tricked into eating them, or did you eat them knowing the consequences?"

"I ate them of my own free will. I knew what it would mean. It would mean that, whatever I should make of my life, it would be mine. My husband, whatever his character, would be my choice. Hades, is the truest expression of what you call greed. He takes away from others so he may possess things solely for himself, in the fortress named so aptly after him. But if he saw in me merely a pretty girl and an obedient wife he was mistaken, for my life I have always kept mine, no matter how tempestous it always seems.

"I believe you have most certainly got me off topic, but I believe I can tie back in. You too have a life for your own for the taking, if you work out how."

"There's still that something about the ticket and your decision to give it to me."

"Yes. Of course, the "why", the motives of a being of life and death is beyond your human grasp. But you will I think be able to deduce that your heart and mind were ready for the tickets."

"I sure as hell haven't felt ready for all this."

"Perhaps not for the direction your story has taken, but consider where you were. You were writing papers on ancient Greek history, specifically as ancient as the documentary evidence could show. You were obsessed with figures your colleagues insisted there were not enough documents to draw any conclusions about. In short you were trying to write history without proper documents--in complete contradiction to what you had been taught to do as a scholar. You were looking for knowledge outside scholarly boundaries. Then you received it, in the documents, yes, but beyond your wildest dreams with the ticket. There's still time to watch that film, but, of course, it would be impossible to come back to your old self if you watched it."

"Then of course I'll watch it."

"Hmm... I don't quite think you understand. That film is in one of the proper Theatre of Hades."

"In Hades?"

"Yes, and there is another complication. The ticket will be taken at the Theatre, and they'll be no one to give it to you."

"I already have it."

Persephone pointed at the wall, which upon inspection, was a one way mirror into a room with a younger Dr. Creed. One muttering about yet another day of blank student faces. 

"I didn't choose to give you that ticket. You did. You were given a decision about what to do with your ticket. You were given the opportunity into a land beyond life, and a land behind the illusion of cause and effect that is created by time. You made the decision, I recall, to give the ticket to your past self... though you should not take that to mean you must make the same decision." 

Creed did not see that desire for the bounds of human knowledge as he considered his decision. He saw his night of unexpected passion with Electra. He saw too, that day he had saved Cora from jellyfish exodus, and the momentary extraordinary satisfaction from it... as if he had saved his own daughter. He also squinted his brain at an academic career not stymied by an obsession with an impossible and contradictory quest, one in which publication was a tangible possibility. 

"I should like to give myself the ticket." 

"Walk through the mirror, and put them on the desk. You will be rather invisible, for humans cannot see their future selves. You will then notice the ticket on your desk after re-entering it from a break."

"How do I get back?"

"You don't suppose I'd leave a time hole open in my study for more than just moments. I'll leave a fissure to go back to your old life. Now if you don't mind, this form is tedious. If you wish to continue, I should like another one.

"By all means."

The face and standing robed figure slid together in a sitting position, and something seemed to break off and become something separate all together. The form had not quite made its way into curves and angles the human eye is comfortable with, but it didn't matter. This form had been painted a thousand times by artists, hack and genius alike, as a Madonna.

"Mary?" 

"Yes, and of course my famous son. My feminine aspect is much more restrained in this story, but I like it."

"A god chooses a young woman for his own." 

"For different ends and motives. Though birth, death, and rebirth are just as important. If there is something about this story which is unclear."

"No," Creed responded. "I'm a thinker. Maybe you should leave me a bit puzzled and curious."

"Ahh yes. The rebirth of reality lies in the imagination. I'm sure you shall see it in your life, if not the world's."




 there were really no way near that building, which might be guarded, but through the sewer. More muck. Damp, foul smelling muck. 

There hadn't been any reason for him to go through that sewer of course. He was still in the position to go home, still in the postion to tell Electra he hadn't found anything. But he hadn't quite his job, risked life and limb, doubted his sanity, nor left behind a must unexpected love interest to turn back, even if nothing but hardship or death remained when he reached out of the sewer and entered the door of that building. 

Never before had he truly understood the fate of the tragic heroes he so greatly remembered from his tales. How they continued to their terrible fate practically knowing it was coming, never turning behind to consider a normal life. How they madly followed their wretched circumstance until--and this was always true of the best tragedies--they missed that chance to turn back. It was because they had too much invested in their own course of action to turn back, and this too was clear now for it was the case with him.

### Persephone's Speech

"Clearly you are not a deity of the afterworld, someone who understands death beyond which a human has the capacity for understanding. It is easy for you, of course to know physical death, which all living things face, and it has crossed your minds of death as a metaphor, the death of a movement, the death of an idea, the death of an age. But things such as the death of reality or the death of time are still very much out of your grasp. 

"You see the world as an ant does, only perceiving those things which aid in your survival. You cannot see in the dark as so many nocturnal predators can, nor can you find your way through sound alone. Thus you cannot perceive when reality is about to die, though the vaguest notions of such occur amongst the best and brightest, the madmen and the prophets, that something new is being born from the corpse that is dying, as your world is. 

"But something new can only be borne from the seeds of what came before." Creed interjected.

Something of a strange smiled came about Persephone's face, toothless or one side and glinting white on the other.

"It is rare for me to encounter someone so perceptive. The Theatre of HADES, of course, was my idea, bound as I am to both the living and dead world as no other truly is. The seed of a new reality, is of course the imagination, and no where in the human imagination is their quite room for so expansive an act as fiction, something humans seem to prefer over this concept the have of truth. But that is another matter."

"These stories. I still have a ticket to the Theatre of HADES. Am I to watch something here?"

"That depends. What that film here and you'll never return. But that is where the Theatre for that ticket resides."

"So... I'm not in the underworld."

"Heavens not. You would of course, never return. This is a private study of mine, when I make preparations to return for the spring. It has been a long, long winter. What am I to do with this ticket?"

Persephone's look was stern and probing. Creed understood she wanted him to answer. 

"Give it to someone else."

"What makes you say this?" She asked amused. 

"I wonder if these tickets are designed to lead someone here, or some place just like it, and I've made it here without the aid of this film."

"Have you? Because I should imagine you would have never made to this place if it hadn't come into your possession in the first place. That you'd still be trying to decipher documents of a new reality waiting to be born, that briefly flickered into existence on your desk many months ago."

"Can I return to an age I desire," Creed asked.

"I told you time doesn't quite work the way anyone thinks it does. You may return to any age your desire of course, though it would be quite difficult to conceive of a reality in which you didn't. I wouldn't strain your brain trying to think of it. But if you wish to leave your existence behind forever, to travel the ages and see the film that ticket is for, you're more than welcome. It would be the more interesting choice."

"I've had enough interesting. the new life I see ahead of me is quite sufficient."
