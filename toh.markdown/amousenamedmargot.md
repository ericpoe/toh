Dr. Creed barreled down 1-70 in the pouring rain, trying to keep his eyes on the road, he'd put St. Louis and much of the rest of Missouri behind him and the place was already beginning to stretch out, the length between exits growing in distance with every smile. 

On the shoulder was a human figure, on a westward course, but it's small size and the pouring rain made it impossible to see until his vehicle shot a stream of water on it.

Dr. Creed braked and came to an immediate halt. He couldn't, in his trip to Vegas, to hook up with his new Arab journalist contact, avoid picking up a hitchhiker. The road was likely to put him asleep, and the trip would definitely seemed stained. He hoped he would be forgiven for the drenching, though one really couldn't get any wetter. He reached over and opened the door.

She walked in and sat in the passenger's seat, closing the door. She said nothing, and her size made him wonder if he weren't picking up a run away. With a good look, though, she had a few too many lines to be younger than her late twenties.

"Where were you headed?"

"Out of the rain. You?"

"Las Vegas."

"Oh? You don't seem the Vegas type."

"Not to gamble."

"Oh... you lonely?"

"I'm off to meet a reporter."

"Oh? what sort of news?"

"I'm not entirely sure. Probably political. No, definitely political."

She didn't say anything for a while.

"Could you introduce me?"

"A name might help."

Again, silence. "Call me Mouse."

Dr. Creed turned the key and proceeded to get on the road.

"You don't sound like you like that name."

"An old nickname."

"You didn't like it, did you Mouse?"

"No I didn't---for a long time. But it grew on me."

"It must have been very small."

"What?"

"To grow on you. It must have been small."

"Oh. Ha. Ha."

"I'll have to work on my humor."

"Oh, no perfectly funny. I'm just not up for laughing. Mr..."

"Dr. Creed."

"And what are you a doctor of?"

"The classics."

"An academic. Isn't school in session?"

"I'm on sabbatical."

"Nice to get a break sometimes. Me? I teach biology."

"Also on sabbatical?"

"Yes."

"Two teachers off to Vegas in February rain."

"Sounds like a terrible poem."

"I should change it to snow. but I think I should be happy it's not or you'd have froze to death."

"Just go to a drive thru and get me some tea. On second thought get me to a liquor store and get me a drink."

"How about tea?"

"You must not invoke the wrath of Mouse! I can be deadly."

"Oh, and drink for the lady. Maybe a change of clothes too? You don't seem to have packed much of anything."

"So I left in a hurry. I want a drink."

"Should we stop off and get some clothes?"

"Do you think we could wait? Buy something in Kansas?"

"Do you know any stores in Kansas?"

"No."

"We'd probably..."

"Wrath of Mouse!"

"I suppose we can wait. You're a strange one, you are."

"And you're not?"

"What makes you say that?"

"What else would make you want to teach a foreign culture in the Midwest? Any Greek relatives?"

"No. I kind of took after my uncle. An academic."

"And I'm sure his family thought highly of it."

"Umm... they only thought highly of him because he was thought highly of by others. I'm the only one who really looked up to him."

"What did he do to rile them up?"

"Nothing. Well, he didn't seem to understand that social status is given to people who are right. Which was funny, because his pay depended on it.

"So here we are: run down thrift store in Kansas. You want some new clothing?"

"That'd be good."

"You do plan to go inside, don't you?"

"Uh..."

"It's six fifteen. Don't know how much later they'll be open."

"Would you check?"

"What's wrong?"

"I have a phobia of thrift stores."

"I'm going to get out of the car and pretend I believe that."

Dr. Creed exited his car and went to look at the hours printed on the glass.

"Come on," he told Mouse, looking back at the car. They close at 6:30."

"Then hurry." Mouse replied.

"I haven't shopped for women's clothing before."

"twenty three inch waist, 32B, tee-shirt small."

Dr. Creed went to the door, and collected himself. It was a strange request, but he figured he knew why he was making it. If he pretended it made sense to him, perhaps anyone else inside would do the same, provided no one saw him stand in the door.

When he opened the door, a lone girl was waiting behind a counter with a bored look on her face, a cellphone in her hands, and gum coming out in bubbles from her mouth.

It'd been a long time since he'd seen a girl her age with bubble gum. He had memories of gum chewers being his worst students, though he realized he needn't worry about this sort of thing.

He knew he shouldn't linger and stare, tempting as it was. Getting through this with some dignity required a cool demeanor. So he walked straight up and said the only thing he could think of."

"I need help. I'm shopping for clothes for my girlfriend."

"My advice is to shop somewhere else. But no one follows my advice, so what would you like?"

"Why would I shop somewhere else?"

"The clothing here is cheap."

"Well it's second hand, not garbage right?"

"Something tells me you're not good with women."

"What's that got to do with anything?"

"Nothing. so what's her size? I'm certain I could find her something nice."

"You sound excited."

"I don't get to shop often, on account of being broke. Now if I can shop with someone else's money..."

"I see. Well she uh..." What kind of "look" might he offer her? It hadn't occurred to him when he walked in. find things that fit. But then his new riding buddy seemed to want to be incognito. "She likes things to have a few miles on them."

"Clearly."

"Well, 23 inch waist, 32B."

"How tall is she?"

"5'1". 5'2" maybe."

"Petite."

"Yes."

"You like a dainty look?"

"She's 20-something. Don't doll her up."

The last thing he wanted was Mouse to not dress her age and remind him of a college freshman. The was a barrage of questions about tastes and colors, of which he always deferred by asking for a specific piece of clothing, restating every question into an either / or format, Then picking his gut response twice and his second guess the third time. He felt himself in the role of a student trying to pretend just enough knowledge to make a passing grade.

There was the potentially awkward task of selecting undergarments. Mouse didn't seem to have duplicates of anything. But if there was any embarrassment to be had, his secret shopper wasn't showing it, so he pretended it was perfectly normal.

truthfully, the only particularly annoying part of the whole affair was her constant interrupting the shopping to check her phone. He couldn't tell if she decided she wouldn't fall behind on her texts or if she were searching the web for fashion trivia.

The girl worked her way through the stock, at last working in the decision of a blouse. "What color are her eyes?"

He didn't remember. "Green."

"This shade of green?" She pointed to a potential selection.

"Hmm. The really does match her eyes."

"Well then that's it. Quite the ordeal for $20 dollars of clothes."

"Thanks, um..."

"Tracy."

"You really went the extra mile."

"Not too many strange people, town this size. Little boring. Your name stranger?"

Dr. Creed smiled. "Jonathon". He paid in cash then walked out the door. Mouse caught his exit immediately, glaring. When he got to the car he could feel her impatience.

"Took you long enough."

"the salesgirl help me."

"Some help."

"Well, I didn't think you'd want something that just got thrown together. To know you were out of fashion everywhere you went. You don't want to stick out like a sore thumb do you?"

Her demeanor changed. She looked downwards and spoke softly, "No I don't. Could we just get back on the road? Well, maybe a burger drive thru, then the road."

"It's not always easy to find a motel in the dark. Do you have to go to the bathroom?"

She looked annoyed. "I do know."

"Why don't you want anyone to recognize you?" Creed asked.

She wasn't hiding it too well, but didn't expect the question then and there."

"I'll tell you at the motel. First bathroom, food, drive."

"Can do. Just try not to forget who's tagging along."

Dr. creed, a veteran of tedium, found driving Kansas interstates a challenge on his stamina. Mouse was uneasily silent most of the time.

"So uh..." he finally started. "What are you on sabbatical for?"

"I'm uh..." Mouse scrambled for words. "I've got this, a, um, non-thing."

"An NDA?"

"Yeah, Non-Disclosure Agreement."

"For a biologist."

"Again, can't really talk about it."

"Well then not about your current project, but in general. [Hade][Extremophile]. Have you ever come across something your academic training says is impossible. Something you have to fight your so-called knowledge to take a second look?"

"I've done some work with extremeophiles. The kind of life that thrives in places you wouldn't think it would."

"Such as?"

"Volcanic vents, highly acidic or saline environments, that sort of thing."

"Tell me more."

"Well... how do I put this? Ordinarily and this was the case for my research it is in some ways trivial."

"Trivial?"

"Well, extremophiles are generally so odd or rare that they stick to their niche, and you don't see their structures repeated outside the extreme environments. So they end up becoming the exception that proves the rule, not the exception that disproves it. Does that make sense?"

"Some strange oddity, a weird, interesting-for-its-own-sake, but nothing in the end, a kind of circus freak show, that you pay the carnival barker and just go back home."

"Yeah."

"I don't know if I could agree with those sentiments."

"You don't have to. That's just the way it is. My God Kansas is flat."

"Yeah, if you're looking for elevation this isn't the place to be."

"Isn't the driving a tad boring?"

"It is difficult to pay attention to the road. You cold?"

"Oh, I guess a change of clothes and a shower would be nice."

"Yeah, I should stop and get gas."

"Then you can tell me about your impossibility."

Dr. Creed put down a lightly spotted paper bag onto the small table provided in the room. The bag did not contain food, but the closest facsimile that could be found at this hour. Mouse was in the shower at the moment, but on the table was an open bottle of white win and the clear plastic cups so often find in motels. Only a small amount had been consumed in his absence. Mouse must have picked it up at the gas station without his noticing. 

Dr. Creed sat down to collect his thoughts. How much of his story to relate? She seemed a sympathetic intellectual. But he thought he might pass on the confetti factory. Maybe if she stuck around for a while, he thought. He really wanted her input on one part of the story at a time, even though technically it was still in progress and he might never finish. 

The shower water had stopped, and Mouse stepped into the room wrapped in two oversized towels. It appeared the motel had "one size fits all" large towels, and the one wrapped around her head looked about ready to fall off. 

Her legs looked as though she'd neglected to wash them for a moment, until Creed realized she must not have had a razor.

"clothes?" she asked, pointing to the bag at Creed's feet. She must have forgotten to take them into the shower. He pushed the bag over towards her, and she bent over to pick it up. she was holding one towel in each hand, and the towel over her head fell to the floor.

Creed went to pick it up, but she replied, "Leave that there. I'll be back for it. Creed let it lay, and started thinking about what he was going to say.

Not just to her, but his journalist friend too. Intelligent mutant bees. On film of course, but quite possibly a documentary. Anything was possible at this point.

Margot exited the bathroom and interrupted his thoughts.

"What are you smiling about?" she asked.

"Nothing." 

"Oh come on."

"What?"

"Say it."

"Well... I can't tell. You look like a hopeless fashion trendy girl trying to be bohemian, or a bohemian hopelessly trying to be fashionable."

"You don't mean that. I'm not hopeless, am I?"

"No I mean... you look nice. Beautiful even. I just never know the right words to say when."

"Maybe this will help," she said, closing her eyes and moving slowly towards a kiss. More than enough time for him to react, but he didn't. 

Their lips met and his body stiffened..

"What's the matter?" she asked. "You've been looking at me all day."

"You were sopping wet. I thought you'd catch a cold."

"How Sweet!" she smiled. "But you don't worry about little Margot."

"Is that your real name?"

Margot stopped, flummoxed."

"Wait, what did I say?" Creed asked. He imagined waking up the next day asking himself how he could ask such a dumb question, but for the moment he was certain he hadn't done anything wrong."

"Nothing. I just wanted to escape that name for a while."

"So you think a night in a Kansas motel room with a stranger is going to help?"

"I suppose not."

"Look, I can tell you're on the run from something. I have no idea what, but I'm on the run too."

"No sabbatical?"

"Not one recognized by my university.l"

"that means no."

"I can't get away from reality. Or lack thereof. I'm not sure."

"Why don't you lie down. Compose your thoughts."

"Sure," Creed flopped on the bed. Margot followed.

"Hey! Creed protested.

"If I flop on the other bed, I''l fall asleep. I want to hear what you have to say."

"Fair enough. I don't know where to start. When the unexpected happens, the truly unexpected, you can't ignore it. You've got to look at it and deal with it. But how do you do that? If you knew how to do that, the events would be unexpected."

"You beliefs aren't what they were." Margot added. "You aren't who you were."

"Exactly. So I was sitting in my office. grading papers..." he looked over at Margot. Here eyes were closed. 

"I'm listening." she responded to the silence. Just letting my eyes rest."

Creed had heard that line before. But he launched into his story about ancient documents and the secret of Atlantis anyway. When he was finished he looked over her and she was sleeping soundly. 

"Practice for when I tell my story tomorrow," Creed muttered, and went to the bathroom before retiring. 

He came back to the problem of beds. It would be a little awkward to get back in the same bed with Margot. But then it might be a little awkward if he didn't get back in the same bad. He wasn't quite sure which would be worse. So he curled back into the bed Margot was sleeping in. It was closer to the bathroom.

Dr Creed awoke in the morning to find Margot watching Animal Planet and nibbling on pretzels. 

"You know it's been a long time since I watched television," Creed announced, startling Margot.

"Me too."

"Funny, they probably spent more on the television than the furniture."

"Well, you can't distract yourself from a crappy television by laying down on a nice bed."

"You haven't done any teaching have you?"

"I've played hostess a few times. Same thing."

"I'll have to ask you to explain that when I wake up."

"So long as you're awake when you get behind the wheel."

"Well, tell me a story. then we'll die for certain."

Margot chuckled, "I'm listening with my eyes closed. I fooled myself on that one. I'm guessing you weren't convinced.

"Where did you drift off?"

"Near the beginning."

"Well then let's get packed, and I'll start for the top." 

"Sure," Margot replied, picking up a pen, the hotel scratchpad, and her pile of wet clothes.

"Just leave those here," creed told her. "no one will mind."

"True, but I'd like to throw them out just the same."

Creed hadn't much to do but change clothes. then it was off to the first drive thru available, for grease, carbs, and caffeine. He figured there would be a dumpster. Margot tossed her clothes and an unexpected smile came over her face.

"Now we can really get started for the day."

"I feel lighter. So tell me your story."

Dr Creed. juggled asking her questions of her knowledge of ancient Greece whilst ordering a mess that could keep them going for the next eight hours.

"Tell me about Greece," Margot protested.

When he finished, he replied, Of course the story is about my experience with Ancient Greece, not what you know, but I have to know you have context."

"Of course."

"So I don't struggle to read Greek anymore. It's not as practiced as English, but I don't struggle with it. So I find this text. It is challenging. Just the combination of unusual and archaic phrases--archaic even by Greek standards.
