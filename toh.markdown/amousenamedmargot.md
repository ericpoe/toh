Dr. Creed barrelled down 1-70 in the pouring rain, trying to keep his eyes on the road, he'd put St. Louis and much of the rest of Missouri behind him and the place was already beginning to stretch out, the length between exits growing in distance with every smile. 

On the shoulder was a human figure, on a westward course, but it's small size and the pouring rain made it impossible to see until his vehicle shot a stream of water on it.

Dr. Creed braked and came to an immediate halt. He couldn't, in his trip to Vegas, to hook up with his new Arab journalist contact, avoid picking up a hitchhiker. The road was likely to put him asleep, and the trip would definitely seemed stained. He hoped he would be forgiven for the drenching, though one really couldn't get any wetter. He reached over and opened the door.

She walked in and sat in the passenger's seat, closing the door. She said nothing, and her size made him wonder if he weren't picking up a run away. With a good look, though, she had a few too many lines to be younger than her late twenties.

"Where were you headed?"

"Out of the rain. You?"

"Las Vegas."

"Oh? You don't seem the Vegas type."

"Not to gamble."

"Oh... you lonely?"

"I'm off to meet a reporter."

"Oh? what sort of news?"

"I'm not entirely sure. Probably political. No, definitely political."

She didn't say anything for a while.

"Could you introduce me?"

"A name might help."

Again, silence. "Call me Mouse."

Dr. Creed turned the key and proceeded to get on the road.

"You don't sound like you like that name."

"An old nickname."

"You didn't like it, did you Mouse?"

"No I didn't---for a long time. But it grew on me."

"It must have been very small."

"What?"

"To grow on you. It must have been small."

"Oh. Ha. Ha."

"I'll have to work on my humor."

"Oh, no perfectly funny. I'm just not up for laughing. Mr..."

"Dr. Creed."

"And what are you a doctor of?"

"The classics."

"An academic. Isn't school in session?"

"I'm on sabbatical."

"Nice to get a break sometimes. Me? I teach biology."

"Also on sabbatical?"

"Yes."

"Two teachers off to Vegas in February rain."

"Sounds like a terrible poem."

"I should change it to snow. but I thik I should be happy it's not or you'd have forze to death."

"Just go to a drive thru and get me some tea. On second thought get me to a liquor store and get me a drink."

"How about tea?"

"You must not invoke the wrath of Mouse! I can be deadly."

"Oh, and drink for the lady. Maybe a change of clothes too? You don't seem to have packed much of anything."

"So I left in a hurry. I want a drink."

"Should we stop off and get some clothes?"

"Do you think we could wait? Buy something in Kansas?"

"Do you know any stores in Kansas?"

"No."

"We'd probably..."

"Wrath of Mouse!"

"I suppose we can wait. You're a strange one, you are."

"And you're not?"

"What makes you say that?"

"What else would make you want to teach a foreign culture in the Midwest? Any Greek relatives?"

"No. I kind of took after my uncle. An academic."

"And I'm sure his family thought highly of it."

"Umm... they only thought highly of him because he was thought highly of by others. I'm the only one who really looked up to him."

"What did he do to rile them up?"

"Nothing. Well, he didn't seem to understand that social status is given to people who are right. Which was funny, because his pay depended on it.
