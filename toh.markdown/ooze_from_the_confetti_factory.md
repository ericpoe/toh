Film 1:

Ooze from the Confetti Factory



Avery picked up the contraption Shawn had placed on his desk. He shook it, as instructed. An alternating croak and rattle came from the device.

“Well?” Shawn asked. “Like nothing you've ever heard before?”

“It sounds like a frog stuck in an engine.”

“Well that's not how I'd call it but it's unique. Novel. That's what we're in the business for? Novelties? Wait until you see how little material went in...”

“I can't sell this Shawn.”

“What? You can sell anything.”

“Ok, I won't sell this Shawn. It'd be too much energy. Stick to what works. Stick to the confetti business.”

“I can't believe I'm hearing this. You don't want to try a new product?”

“There are limits to what you can sell Shawn. You'd know that if you ever had to actually peddle on of your inventions.”

“Ok...”

“I don't mean to sound overly harsh.”

“You know I'm no good as a salesman.”

“I might have tried to sell that a few years ago. But things are different. We have the confetti factory now. And two dozen employees. The dozen employees without a wit of initiative in them. These days I don't wan't to ask what I can sell. I want to know what will sell. And a decapitated frog noise won't move.

“Not that I don't value your talents. Your refinement of confetti manufacture has been an art. Twice the colors and half the cost eh? When are you going to get my stuff to glow in the dark, huh?”

“Not at the price you're looking for. But I can go back to the drawing board I guess.”

“You guess, Shawn? You guess?”

“Confetti is boring. It just pops for a momentary thrill, then leaves a mess.”

“The customers want that mess. You give it to them. So well that I'm thinking of expanding.”

“When were you going to tell me that?”

“Oh I wouldn't expand the company without you. I just didn't want...”

“Want what?”

“To talk to you without a clear idea in mind.”

“Wait what? You've always looked for my output.”

“Yes but...”

“But what?”

“But you're not a salesman. You wouldn't get the salesy stuff.”

“As if it's that complicated.”

“You've never had an appreciation for the nuances. You don't understand your customer base. You hate parties yet you become an engineer for a confetti factory. This is still a toy store for you. Well it isn't for me.”

“What's that supposed to mean?”

“Well, I've been in contact with a financier named Lars. He has whole new methods, looking for a nimble company like ours to adopt it.”

“Nimble? I've never heard that term from you. Why doesn't he go to a large supporter?”

“Who says he didn't? He said a factory like ours would be perfect.”

“For what?”

“Check this out,” Avery pulled out a binder thicker then a shoe box. “A whole new inventory.”

“New inventory?”

“Words. He wants words on the confetti. You always complain about confetti being so much waste paper?”

“So are we going into the fortune cookie business?”

“No. Just remember what I said, know your customers? They want phrases on their confetti.”

“What kind of phrases? Can I look at the binder?”

“Hey, don't get too grabby Shawn.”

“At least let me look in the binder. I'm your engineer. You can't sell a product you can't make.”

“Here. Don't let your eyes linger. I don't have all day.”

“Hmm... phrases.. 'it's simply un-American'? 'the American people deserve better'? 'Let's put it this way', 'But the numbers are misleading.' ”

“I told you not to linger.”

“This is what sells?”

“Oh yes. 7 million.”

“Gross?”

“Net.”

“Whoa. So what's the process? It must be technical. I'll go through it so we can consider his offer.”

“No. I took the offer. I'm not turning down 52% of an offer like that. You're still in line for 21%. You in?”

“I want to see the process.”

“Who cares about the process?” Avery balked, “7 million.”

“I know. That's 1.4 million for me. But I want to see the printing process.”

“You sure?”

“Why are you so testy about the plans?”

“Lars said my technical people might get skittish. You own 21%...”

“Is that why you've been avoiding me? Give it here.”

“Be careful, you'll break it.” Avery pulled the binder away.

“That binder's solid as a truck and half the size.” He yanked an edge while Avery was trying to whisk it away. He yanked hard like a younger brother wanting his toy back. Avery did not expect such a jerk and conceded the plans.

“The steam freeze methods... wait, what the hell does the system need liquid nitrogen for?”

“See. He told me to be careful with technicalities.”

Shawn flipped to another page of the binder, and scanned through it, “Hmm... at STP this compound is a liquid. Under more frigid conditions... this is bold.”

“They'll be putting in the system over the next few weeks. I want to keep you as plant engineer, so study these plans and make sure you can understand them.”

“And know what to do if there's a short, a fire, a spill.”

“Yeah, that too. Shawn... here's to a lot of money.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Avery, my partner, you've no doubt began preparations for expansion.” Lars stated, seating himself in front of his desk. You'll need to lure more personnel of course. I've brought my associate Ms. Whitmore to discuss business. Karen, why don't you sit?”

Karen obliged, and as her body came directly into view he could see she was voluptous. But there was a chill in her demeanor that gave an imperiousness to her movements. Her eyes were cold and distant.

“You're going to have to hire a great deal of people, and fire a few.”

“Why should I fire someone when expanding? I mean I work with idiots but this is factory labor.”

“You work with idiots?” Karen bemused. The phrase had more power in her voice than his.

“Well, Lars brought you on as a hiring consultant?”

“I'm an organizational psychologist. I advise companies on how to make the most of their employees.”

“Then advise me,” Avery responded, more defensively than intended.

“There is one type of employee that you want to think, and the other where you don't. Or perhaps more precisely there are employees you don't want to think outside the attention they need to perform their tasks. The others you want thought, initiative, energy. To think outside the box, when necessary.”

“I can never get those two sorted out.”

“How are they paid? Wages, commission, salary, or company share?”

“Wages mostly. My accountant has a salary. My engineer has a share.”

“So you really only need your engineer.”

“Well, Jessica, she had a share. We split the company three ways.”

“She had her share?”

“Yes.”

“No ambition.”

“Harsh way of looking at it. She didn't like making business decisions. Just wanted to keep the books and earn a salary. A family woman.”

“I see. You have a good rapport. Give her a raise. You'll be making more.”

“I'm sure that'll make her happy.”

“What about your engineer?”

“Shawn? He's just as lacking in business savvy as he ever has been, but he's still got a share. Sometimes he pulls through with a new method or invention. But he has little idea about what makes money.”

“It's essentially he accepts the manufacturing process,” Lars insisted, taking Avery off guard. He leaned in closer, and looked him directly in the eye “even if he doesn't understand it.”

“What if he doesn't?. He's a partner.”

“Look Avery. I understand you have a history. But you've also got a 52% share,” Lars didn't hesitate to point out.

“Look Lars,” Avery said in impatience and then looked at Lars. He wondered if he was being stared down. He readjusted his tie and continued, “Machines, chemicals, engineering, Shawn loves that kind of thing. He won't be a problem.”

“Good. Oh and your factory could use a name change. 'Already Confetti' sounds like small time. Try the 'American Party Supply Institute.'

“Gotta nice ring to it.”

“I'll let you discuss more business with my associate. I'm off to a meeting.” Lars yawned.

“So you were saying who I value, Karen?” Avery tried to pick up where the two had left off.

“Many companies don't solidly identify their valuable employees, or have a firm grasp on how to let them work to their optimum.”

“You know it's not like I don't think about these things. But managing people, well...”

“There haven't been any attempts at unionizing, have there? That's most undesirable for a business. Your labor costs would skyrocket.”

“I hadn't been thinking unions.”

“It's good practice to keep an eye out on that. Agitate, Educate, Organize. It's effective.”

“Agitate?”

“Get folked riled enough to motivate, teach things could be different, make an organization for action.”

“Oh.”

“The whole method flounders if agitate is countered with apathy.”

“Wait why are we going into anti-labor strategy? No one's tried to strike.”

“You said you don't trust your workers.”

“The motley bunch. Dumb and dumber.”

“Then you have labor problems. Besides, you're going to be running a different kind of company once the process is set up.”

“Yes. The process. Want to make sure workers adjust to the process. Did Lars tell you what that would be?”

“I'm not authorized to speak on that point Avery.”

“Well... the kind of confetti that's really popular has print on it.”

“Often produced by the employees themselves.”

“Oh. I've yet to hear of this.”

“That's because you're selling to small time clients.”

“I...” Avery protested reflexively after 'small time'. “We deal with some big name distributions.”

“No you don't. But you will. Now, the confetti, it will have print. Not more than 100 characters, shorter being better. A phrase is best.”

“Like 'I love you' on candy hearts?”

“Somewhat. Some of these phrases will be provided. But some of them must be employee provided.”

“What? I can't give control of my product to the rank and file. That's for me and Shawn to discuss.”

“If your product is produced by your employees than your employees are your product.”

“I suppose. But most of it is dull factory work. People are here for the money. How do you suggest I change that?”

“Well, it depends on what you print. Some buyers want political slogans, but that market's covered. Celebrities, that's locked down. Here,” Karen pulled out some dossiers and a few scattered spreadsheets. There are plenty of confetti themes.”

Avery looked down the list, “Entertainment, Technology, Sports, Games, Politics, News, Personals, Music... hmm... Gambling?”

“There are some untested processes in gambling.”

“Untested? Sounds interesting. What am I looking at? Blackjack?”

“We could have a dealer and attendant services.”

“What?”

“A black jack dealer can mean loads for a business. People can gamble away their wages.”

“I... that's clever. There are some workers I wouldn't need to pay as much. Why let them lose money gambling on their own time? Might cause some problems with management though, employing gambling addicts.”

“Not at all. I have a study...” Karen flipped through a dossier to a paper entitled, “The Psychology of Work Place Gambling.” Avery couldn't see it too well but guessed it was over twenty pages.”

“I don't need that level of detail.”

“Well, it has to do with the psychology of debt. People work harder and complain less when paying back a debt they think is their fault even if their debt was preplanned, as would be the case.”

“Hmm... interesting, let's definitely go for a blackjack dealer. In the lunchroom?”

“Yes, if that's were you'd like to put it.”

“Yeah, that's where I'll put it. Hmm... what about this, music jukebox. It'd be snazzy to have one of those around.”

“Ah... music. Music in the workplace. One of my favorite subjects.”

“Oh?”

“Yes,” Karen replied. “Few people have an appreciation for how sound affects their daily activities. Peace and quiet. The early risers and the night owls do their best work in it. But it can be an intensely nerve wracking experience. So what is the best course of action? Play music loud enough to hear, quiet enough to filter out. The brain doesn't sit still. So give it just enough external stimulus not to notice emptiness.”

“So what does this have to do with business?”

“The jukebox comes with about 400 pre-programmed songs. None is challenging or jarring in any way. They send out a subtle message. 'Mediocrity. Complacency.' and your workers will go comfortably numb.”

“And do what I tell them for once?”

“Yes.”

“Done.”

“How about college sports? I'm a big football fan.”

“That field's locked at the pro level. But college, on the other hand, is so regional, so dispersed, such a heterogeneous fan base...”

“So what's the package?”

“College football in the lunch room. Teams few care about of course. Accomplishes the same effect.”

“What about the teams I care about?”

“You going to be eating in the lunch room?”

“No.”

“Record them in hi def at home.”

“Point taken. Then employees just type short messages?”

“There will be terminals. Messages can be print pretty much as soon as they're entered.”

“Shouldn't I look at them first?”

“No. It works better that way. Don't want your employees to think this is some way to monitor them.”

“Point taken. Well, interested in seeing this contract.”

“It will be long.”

“Hmm... maybe I should hand it over to Jessica. She has an eye for that sort of thing.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“I don't know about this contract Avery,” Jessica looked down at the floor.

“Will we be making money Jessica?”

“Hand over fist.”

“And we won't be selling our souls? Employing child labor from China, dumping nitric acid into a pristine water supply, defrauding...”

“No, nothing like that. It's just that there are...”

“What?”

“It just doesn't feel right Avery.”

“There you go. Like always. Playing the  reluctantly involved bookkeeper.”

“I'm not reluctant.”

“You sold your share. You don't own anything. Just the salary I give you. Why is that?”

“I just like keeping the books tidy. I'm good at it. I didn't want to get involved in... company politics.”

“What's that supposed to mean?”

“You know... politics.”

“I really don't know.”

“Well, it doesn't really matter now, does it? Your share is 52%. So the position of CEO is always up to you now.”

“Jessica Lamb. There is something you've been hiding from me all these years. If you've read things over and it's a good contract, I'll sign it.”

“You don't have to sign it.”

“What?”

“The contract is for the chief financial officer. Lars was specific about that.”

“Why would he cut me out?”

“You'll have to read the contract.”

“How long is it?”

“157 pages.”

“All legalese?”

“Most of it,”

“Count me out. Sign it.”

“You sure?”

“What are you hiding Jessica? Come on, I know you're a bit... reserved. We'll go out for a little drink...”

“When I'm off work I'm going to my husband and kids. They'll be waiting on me.”

“Some other time then?”

“Do you want me to sign the contract?”

“Yes, on one condition.”

“What condition.”

“That you accept a 5% share from me.”

“It's been a long time since you didn't have a majority.”

“Oh, it's not that much. Just consider it a bonus for the contract. I want you back on my team.”

“But I've never left.”

“I mean financially.”

“Fine, I'll sign the contract.”

“I don't know when you became the mysterious one. Back when we started, I could read you like an open book. What happened?”

“Time, I guess.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Avery, I've looked over the new process you're looking to implement.”

“Oh really, Shawn? He tried to hide any hint of contempt, having been warned of objections.

“The ingredient list. Hydrofluoric acid, liquid nitrogen, mercury fulminate, what the hell kind of product we making?”

“You don't understand the reactions?”

“They must have invented some new chemistry since I was a grad student. Or perhaps a different business model.”

“What's that supposed to mean?”

“I think the chemistry's solid. It can produce seven times our current load.”

“Then what's the problem?”

“Our factory equipment. It wasn't designed for this kind of hazardous material.”

“What's going to go wrong?”

“I can't tell.”

“You can't tell. You can't tell? Our profit goes up five times, 21% yours by the way, and you can't tell?”

“The machines are ten years old. They should last another ten, but...”

“But what?”

“They've got a few duct tape and bubblegum fixes is all.”

“Have they ever failed an inspection?”

“No. But these chemicals are a level dangerous enough to...”

“Are you not satisfied with the money?”

“That's not it at all.”

“Oh. How often are you out on the floor? Often?”

“No. I mostly spend time in my workshop, making things you can't sell.”

“Well, this will sell. You needn't worry after that. 7 million times 21%. You'll be able to make whatever you want. Anything.”

“Well, if there's an industrial accident don't come crying to me.”

“That's the spirit! Or at least part of it. We'll have to work on that.”

“I think I'll be avoiding the lunchroom, if you don't mind?”

“What's that supposed to mean?”

“Nothing. Let's get to work.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shawn scrubbed his hands vigorously trying to get off the new chemical smell off his hands. It failed, but he decided to go into Jessica Lamb's office nonetheless.

“Shawn Aaron!” she said in surprise. “I haven't seen you since...” she smiled “... the new deal.”

“Well you know how it is. Everything has to be put together just so.”

“Making preparations for the new baby?”

“What baby? I'm single.”

“Your engineering baby.”

“Oh, right. That. Well you put something together with your own hands you can't help but invest some of yourself in it.”

“Always the builder, Shawn Aaron.”

“The whole set up is quite impressive … though I must say I can't understand our new customers.”

“Just as well as you didn't understand the old customers... at least that's what Avery thinks.”

“Who care what he thinks? He's just a boss, and he's not here. He's barely been around while I've been doing the retooling. The new printing method is really ingenious. Of course it has a great fifteen syllable scientific name. But we just call it the steam freeze method. It uses liquid nitrogen. You know like back in the day when I did my experiments on possible superconductors? Those were the days. And now they're back. Full industrial chemistry is back in my life.”

“Like a puppy.”

“What?”

“Big name chemistry's gone in your life twelve years, and the moment it's back you jump up and wag your tail, like a puppy upon your coming home.”

“You've always had a way of putting things.”

“You're too simple. You make things too easy.”

“I'm not.”

“Yes you are.”

“No I'm not.”

“Then how do I always do it?”

“Gremlins. In any case, I am impressed by the change.”

“Who wouldn't be impressed? I'm running the books, handling the contracts.”

“Handling the contracts? I know you do the books. But shouldn't Avery handle the contracts?”

“Oh, ordinarily he does but things are a little different. Lars has been discussing new business with him frequently.”

“New business?” Aren't we head long into a major workplace change over?”

“Well, Lars said something about real estate.”

“Real estate? Who does Avery think he is, a land speculator? Damn the money's good but it's not that good.”

“I don't know. Said something about needing to keep his eye on the horizon. You're right though. I've read the contracts. As I said, impressive.”

“What's in them?”

“Oh I wouldn't want to bore you with the technical details.”

“I like technical details.”

“I...” Jessica looked into Shawn's eyes, “I don't want to discuss the contracts.”

“Well, I can mind my business, so long as it's my business. There isn't anything that puts me in a bind?”

“No.”

“What about you?”

“I... I'll be fine. I signed them after all. Besides I don't bear any financial risk. I don't own any shares.”

“I've never understood why you stopped wanting in, but that is your comfort after all. What do you think about the music in the lunch room?”

“I'm eating in the office from now on.”

“Yeah, along with the televisions it makes me feel I'm in a sports bar. And the black jack. Where the hell did Avery come up with that? That dealer is going to have to be paid. Will that really catch on?”

“I handle the books. He'll bring positive revenue.”

“You want to be my spotter? Like the college days?”

“Yeah, like you doubling down on rent?”

“I won that round didn't I? I wouldn't do it these days of course.”

“You damn near gave me a heart attack,” she replied, play punching him.

“Maybe I'll go to Vegas with all the money coming in.”

“I won't be your spotter.”

“I wouldn't ask. You've got a family after all.”

“I'd find myself an eager young mathematics student. Very attractive.”

“Who, you?”

“Yeah. I'm older, got a well paying job, can take her to fancy casinos...”

“Yeah, you'll find a Vegas hotel, spend the night and wake up. No girl, no money.”

“Oh come on Jessica.”

“No clothes...”

“She'd steal my clothes too?”

“Oh yeah, and give them to her fiancee.”

“Jessica?”

“You never had good taste in women Shawn Aaron.”

“You always remind me of old times. But new times, that's what we have now. I'm building new things, not tossing around ideas to have Avery squash them.”

“Always live up to your potential Shawn Aaron.'



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The confetti phrases came in large unlabeled wood crates that smelled of cedar and were lined with silica gel packets labeled 'Do Not Eat'. It seemed odd to Shawn that they not be delivered via computer when efficiency was the name of the game. The phrases were entered manually by a privately contracted employee, who Shawn imagined worked for Lars.

When the man wasn't looking Shawn felt the urge to grab a few strips now and again. “Connect bad economy with Iran.” “Blame budget woes on welfare mothers.”, “Squelch links to real estate firm.” Shawn didn't quite understand what customers might want this kind of confetti, but they must have wanted it for some kind of political party.

Others seemed innocuous. “50 years ago., We mourn the tragic loss.” “Today will always be the day we remember.”

Then the related ones. “That album is a crime against humanity.” “That quarterback couldn't throw a ball to himself,” “I shouldn't have doubled down.” All of the phrases made no sense for party confetti. But if people wanted shreds of paper tossed about carelessly, it seemed perfectly legitimate to comply.

Then came the process of making paper, which did not involve wood pulp. It was a fascinating synthetic process. It started with burning coal. From there came the carbon source for the paper. The fumes were separated from CO2, with great pressure, and advanced filters. The coal impurities in the smoke were separated one by one with steam to heat and liquid nitrogen to freeze. The differences in reaction to heat separated the impurities--some to interact and form various colors of ink.

Purely synthetic paper, purely synthetic ink of 8 separate colors. With this ink it was enough for 512 colors. It was a masterpiece of engineering, and Shawn still had a notebook trying to map how everything got to its destination. In any case, it was a system he could experiment with for years and optimize... provided he got some feedback which was lacking at this point.

The print process gave off the clicking of an author at a typewriter. The clicking was a heady, treble mix to the hissing of compressed gases and the twinkling of ice crystal chemicals. Someday, Shawn wondered if it might turn from an ear-scraping endeavor into a manner of gauging the system, like learning a new language-- impenetrable at first, but snowballing into place. At the end the confetti was separating by a highly adjustable matrix of boron carbide which would never dull though first it was treated with hydrofluoric acid to remove bits of glass that somehow arose during the process.

That was a bit disturbing to Shawn. How glass might end up in the process. Silcion was the most abundant element in the earth's crust, but why the steam freeze process couldn't get rid of it he wasn't sure.

In any case, after all was said and done the confetti also got put back in those boxes, again by people that were probably on Lars' payroll. They marked the boxes with symbols that did not correspond to an alphabet he could recognize from the internet, except that it contained a few Cyrillic characters here and there.

Then the lunch room. The atmosphere overall was quite jovial. That management might provide free entertainment was greatly appreciated even if much of what was available could have been retrieved from a smart phone.

The room was a bit irritating for a few employees and they subsequently refused to eat there. But the response was positive. The sports and music were irritating to Shawn, but he couldn't quite say no the the blackjack table.

It was an old obsession. Time and age kept him from gambling more than $20 at a time, but there had been times he'd paid rent via Atlantic City. At one point it had gone towards tuition. It was a great system for making a reasonable income, provided no one caught you counting cards. He'd had a lovely spotter named Jessica Lamb.

At some point in the university he'd discovered a cheap way to make bulk paper, and a student with deep enough pockets named Avery wanted to start a business. Thus Already Confetti was born.

Was Avery behind this new development – adding the blackjack table on the side after this new setup, or had he simply been thoughtless? In any case, Shawn gambled a little for amusement as he was often exhausted by lunch hour. The American Party Supply Institute. It was a different company.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The first trouble in the American Party Supply Institute came from neither employees nor factory equipment. It came from the jukebox. It began swapping chorus lines from one song into another. At first this was noticeable to only a few employees. This was because the alterations started to appear in the same tone and tempo.

That the alterations should appear in such a fashion was confusing from a technical standpoint. Although the jukebox was most certainly a computer underneath a stylish shell, one would expect if songs became scrambled they should include bits of other songs. But this was not occurring. The chorus lines were clearly changing.

This, thought Shawn, should be a minor hook up. The jukebox was playing altered versions of songs. People would get used to the altered version, made even like it better, and go back to eating. But the alterations never repeated themselves, neither in words, timing of the song, or number or repetitions. It was particularly obnoxious to many. They could not filter out an unpredictable song, and were uneasy when left with their conversations interrupted and thoughts unfinished because they could no longer avoid the songs. They begged to be listened to.

Shawn tried a mere unplugging of the machine, but it must have had batteries for that mitigated nothing. A call to Lars' company for assistance said the machine was not serviceable and the problem could only be fixed with a replacement. For Shawn this was the first sign that the new business contracts and methods had some subtle barbs, loopholes, and traps. Shawn found Avery at complete indifference, a simple “they'll get used to it.”

Shawn decided, against any possible warranty considerations, to open up the machine on his own time. The mish-mashes, after all, might be prerecorded. If so he figured he'd just see some standard electronics. But something else might be different, Shawn thought, and he wasn't one for letting equipment go bad, even if it was nonessential.

Shawn had had to bring in his own toolkit. The screws that held it together did not seem to be chosen by any logical choice he'd known. But after twenty minutes of jostling with specialized screwdrivers he finally got the damn thing open.

Nothing seemed out of place, though noticeably missing was any apparent power source that could explain why it continued to play unplugged. The system also seemed to be contaminated with red splotches of some thick red liquid. It was splattered all over the circuit boards. He couldn't think of where it might come from. But he carefully wiped it off with a static free cloth. Then he put the machine back together and plugged it back in. He might have checked it, but the jukebox played pretty uninteresting pop and he didn't have the time. He figured his employees would figure it out. They were the ones that noticed it in the first place. In the mean time he would try to figure out the mystery substance.

Shawn took the stained cloth and subjected it to a few basic tests. He subjected it to a small daubing of both hydrochloric acid and bleach, neither of which seemed to affect it. Steaming, freezing, drying, nothing seemed to produce any unusual behavior. At a loss he simply checked his pockets, and an old business card fell out. The cardboard was solid white, but what should have been crisp black letters looked like they'd been printed with sewer water. He might have brought it up to Avery, but he couldn't remember how long the card had been in his pocket. His gut told him something important was up. But he resounded to keep things quiet for the time being. Avery never listened unless Shawn could spell out his concerns in permanent marker across his office wall.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



You never can tell who you'll meet in an elevator, Avery muttered under his breath upon getting out onto the 23rd floor of the building where Lars worked. He didn't really know the name of the building, and if pressed he might botch the pronunciation of the company's name. It did seem peculiar. If he worked on the 23rd floor of anywhere he felt like he'd want to proclaim it to anyone and everyone. Lars seemed more muted in his position, but now he'd called Avery in for an impromptu business meeting for reasons he did not clearly explain.

Lars was always trying to sell him something, though not always on a monetary level. Sometimes he was trying to sell Avery on a method or an idea, trying to convince him it had promise, even if it didn't seem he was the intended customer. Avery chucked it up as a quirk or a habit of success. In any case, he always seemed to explain what he wanted up front. It was strange for him to propose a meeting in his office without much advance notice.

Avery hadn't the foggiest idea what was to happen in Lars' office. He somehow imagined a man with lion's heads mounted on the wall from African hunting safaris, authentic swords from the middle ages, and at least five female secretaries under the age of twenty five. But upon opening the door to Lars' office he didn't see that swagger. Everything was in order, and nothing looked cheap. The room had a sort of aura but he couldn't pin it down. But if he let his eyes flitter a bit about the room he couldn't help but noticed hints of brass, like an ancient coin. Lars offered him a cocktail.

“Sit my friend,” Lars stated. His relation to Avery as a something other than a client was easily recognized. Avery took a slow sip. It was white wine of some kind. He didn't know if he liked the taste or not, nor could he deem if it was cheap or expensive. So he just said nothing.

“My number crunchers have found a most interesting development in your factory this week. Your phrases on music are in high demand.”

“I see.” Avery tried to act aloof. There was money to made somewhere, though the nature of the deal wasn't clear. “I just put the system in. You said yourself you needed a nimble company. Someone to embrace a new idea. Your new idea to be perfectly frank. So that particular brand of confetti is taking off?”

“Well, it's hard to say if things are taking off. But the perception is that they're taking off, and in a big way, and we have to act fast while the perception is still there.”

“Are you saying there's a problem with my product?”

“No, no, no.” Lars chided him. “We're not talking about products here. We're talking about sales opportunities. Your music confetti has sold faster than I could have anticipated, and demand should continue. But when you've got a hot product, you've got to treat it like a hot product. You need to hedge against how much you're product is in demand because it's in demand, you understand? Say there'll its expected they'll be a power outage. People start buying batteries because they need them, but also because other people are buying them as well. Then the power outage doesn't come. The battery's still a worthwhile product, but the customer doesn't need it as quickly as thought.”

“Ok. That's easy enough. What's this got to do with the factory?”

“Straight to the point. Good. Let's treat your factory like the power outage. Might a prudent business owner, who knows people are buying batteries just to buy batteries, sell them to a business he also owns, in order to keep people buying batteries for the sake of buying batteries?”

“That's not the kind of business I run.”

“Don't misunderstand me. That's not the kind of proposal I'm making. Just trying to put in real terms what is called a hedge, and it's common business practice. You've got a product to offer, and you're selling for what a client thinks it's worth to pay for it. Now, here's what we do. We create a subsidiary to buy some of your product and then sell it back to your main company by a set time period. That way, if your product price keeps rising, you're good, and if you're just experiencing a price spike, you're also good. You win either way. It's called hedging. Now that you've got a product taking off, you ought to consider this type of service, which my business does more routinely.”

“You don't really have any expertise in my business field?”

“It's not what I deal with everyday, like you would. I have some diversity in my clients. I offer services that help across businesses.”

“You gave me the impression you knew a lot about this 'words as confetti' business.”

“How's your balance sheet?”

“Impressive.”

“Then I knew what you needed as a business. How's the wine?”

“The taste is really subtle, if you take the time to appreciate it.” It was the most sophisticated answer he could give without knowing a thing about white wine.

“I like it. I'll run a contract by that secretary of yours. She's got a real eye for detail.”

“I think I'll go over it. I've got the business degree after all.” Avery tried to hide the snarl in that remark. He wanted Lars' business knowledge, and thought that if his larger business needed to hedge against price spikes and 'perceptive value' that it was certain something to start considering. But something seemed off to him about the timing. Avery bore a big brunt of the risk in expansion. That Lars would start to get chummy after some numbers came off that were much higher than expected... Avery wondered if Lars didn't know if the idea would work, and was trying to put himself in the position to profit greatly off a risk he didn't take.

But then, if Lars was trying to two-time a small business owner he should have tried to be more impressive. He should have offered champange, been wearing a more expensive suit, and spent some time discussing sports cars or some other high sounding snobby subject before he went straight to the point. No, Lars was probably just like any businessman whose idea went well. He had just taken the tone that Avery had just made it big, which he'd scorned as it implied he'd been small. But Lars seemed in earnest in offering the contract and truth be told, if the contract were long, he would prefer Jessica look it over rather than himself.

It was only... Lars' first reaction to his success was to hedge. But then that's what Lars would have done with any successful business, tried to sell his hedge fund's services, right? It was strange. Lars asked what he wanted for and gave you what he offered. He did not imply, he did not say something he didn't mean. He'd seen those business types before. Still, he walked away a little uneasy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Avery... I don't know what to say,” Shawn acknowledged. “I told you there was something wrong with the music. You ignored me, but it was bothering the employees. So I went to fix the machine, and the problem stopped. Now you tell me the employee responses to the music are creating a better product. First you say you want them to get used to it, then you want them to not get used to it, and are blaming me for fixing things...”

“The jukebox wasn't covered by warranty Shawn. You went against contract, and now it's hurting our profit.”

“I'm sorry but as an engineer I get bothered by say, red ooze gushing from a circuit board. What happens if this spreads to the rest of the system?”

“Ok, alright. So it looked like a problem from an engineering perspective, even if it wasn't. The system's new... I can't tell you to watch it for problems and not tamper with it if something doesn't work they way you think it's supposed to work. We'll just have to go back to hoping the machine starts malfunctioning the way it did before.”

“Well, a machine doesn't break the same way unless you hit it the same way. Got any ideas on that?”

“That's your department. My department... I think it's time to call Lars.”

“I think you should wait to discuss business until after the system has proved its mettle.”

“It already has, Lars showed me the numbers. He showed me the demand for the employee submitted music based confetti. Then he told me the price might unexpectedly flip and I should get hedges. Insurance.”

“Wait a minute...”

“I'm tired of waiting a minute for you Shawn. Businessmen don't wait.”

“Lars showed you the numbers?”

“I'm not listening. Not now. Go back and tend to the machines.”

“Shouldn't Jessica have shown you the numbers?” Shawn asked, but his question fell on deaf ears. Avery seemed fine with this indeterminate red substance gathering in his electronics, but Shawn was not. Not until he could riddle out the confetti printing system.

There were really two approaches to the problem. He could try sequentially reading the manual from start to finish and understand the process. But there was also interesting anomalies for which he could try to riddle things out. One of his new jobs was inspections, things vital to the printing process. The liquid nitrogen was being stored at a specific temperature and pressure that had to be checked regularly. The newly delivered coal had to have the right balance of impurities. The water supplied for the steam also had to contain a certain balance of impurities. This last point was particularly counterintuitive to a scientist that took great pains to get distilled water.

So he counted on a plan of trying to map things start to finish, riddling out the system's apparent choke points, and looking at the actual mechanical parts as well to investigate this new machine. And when everyone else had gone home. He opened up the jukebox again. The red driplets had returned. However, as the situation called for him not to wipe them out systematically but collected them in an eye dropper.

He hastened to make sure the substance was sealed well and tight. He planned to send it off to a good scientific laboratory to get it identified at his own expense. Avery didn't perceive an issue but Shawn sure as hell didn't want anyone flash freezed to death or dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. The viscous smudges hadn't get into the main equipment but without knowing their source, he couldn't rule out a contaminant. From there, there was little to do but wait until things got better or worse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The red ooze which had started in the music box now had traces throughout the entire factory. It had been slow to appear, and its pathway was anything but predictable. It started showing up in the filters, which Shawn had replaced twice until giving up on that kind of solution. When Avery mentioned all that money the factory would be making, Shawn reflected, he neglected to tell Shawn one thing: that demand would be so high there'd be little time for any maintenance. The machines were on 24 hours a day, a radical departure from the days when they only needed to keep them on for eight. Maintenance ground production to a halt. So against his instincts as an engineer he let the filters go. They did not seem to change the printing process, which Shawn could not account for.

He looked down at a crumpled sheet in his pocket, a sheet of phrases as of yet uncut into pieces of confetti. These phrases printed on the confetti had been guarded like a trade secret, and you could be certain the final product was surveilled. However, Shawn had been able to pick out an uncut sheet from a worker ever so often. An employee at who worked on the line occasionally inspected those uncut sheets, and Shawn offered his services as a spotter at the dealer. At times he would declare a sheet defaulty and pass it to Shawn when he did well at the tables.

The nature of the phrases had been interesting to say the least. This week seemed a sudden influx in demand for slogans about freedom. Quality seemed to be irrelevant. “One cannot secure the blessings of freedom without liberty.” was one he remembered in particular. One might expect that as some kind of joke, but the general pattern was a scatter shot of slogans about freedom that didn't even make sense as satire, and Shawn was certain whatever client wanted these slogans would cancel their contract within two weeks.

That had been a regular cycle, though it had been hard to gauge at first. Avery just struck him as being horribly moody about the ooze. It never went away when it showed up somewhere in the production cycle. The filters were the first stage in the process. The batches of color started turning red. By Shawn's gauge the number of colors that could be produced had dropped 40%--each possibility replaced by a dark red. But orders did not correlate to the relentless progress of red.

Orders went through a boom and bust cycle. Suddenly orders came out in droves and Avery seemed ecstatic. Shawn would get some uncut sheets during these period, and they would always have some kind of theme. At least keywords would stand out amongst the noise populated by a sheet when the booms and busts calmed. Moreover, the mass orders rarely had more than two colors. Increasingly, as the ooze had spread, this color was red, as the number of other colors (both in variety and printing capacity) were slowing down.

During the busts production was down but there was no keywords and every color on the palette was used. Avery, no doubt, was looking to diversify after a canceled contract. At these moments he would be breathing down Shawn's neck trying to get the ooze out of the factory design. This had been standard practice for Avery, who couldn't determine if the substance was the problem for the failed orders or the boon that caused the sudden influx of business. Regardless of the ups and downs, the red kept showing up in the confetti factory like an open wound on a dying soldier.

The television sets began to act in the same way as the jukebox. The channels wouldn't stay put on sports. Shawn recalled a moment on with the television set locked on C-Span when a politician gushed forth the following plea:



Freedom of Religion is a commandment from God whose sanctity cannot be trampled upon. The murder of a child is murder. It does not matter if that child is elected or not. That child has a right to take up the call to office, and we must respect that right and put that child in office.



during a committee meeting on a budget proposal. He sounded as though he were reading straight from a botched cut and paste job of his own factory's very confetti.

The only way to stay sane at this point, Shawn reckoned, was to accept this mess as the new normal. He resolved merely keep an eye out for weaknesses at the critical points, like the liquid nitrogen tanks or the barrels of hydrofluoric acid and try to riddle out the quirks of the system while understanding that somehow, despite the mess, the product sold. Every so often, in moments of respite, he would wander over to Jessica's office.

This time, when he did so, he heard Avery screaming. Shawn had grown accustomed to Avery's temper when it had been hurled at him. He'd never heard it launched at Jessica. He opened the door without knocking.

“How could you have lost that account? Two weeks ago they were our best customer?”

“I told you when we signed the contract with Lars I had misgivings.”

“Hello Avery,” Shawn stated flatly, as if the exchange weren't taking place.

“Shawn? This is a private meeting.”

“Between the three of us. I'm still a business partner, remember?”

“Alright, fine. Jessica, we don't you tell Shawn how business is going.”

“Certainly. The new proposed system was supposed to ramp up our production seven times. As it stands we're not making that number. We're only at 6.7.”

“That's the problem Jessica?” Shawn asked.

“No. The production's fine. Contract after contract gets cancelled.”

“Not renewed,” Jessica corrected, “they expire monthly, as per the agreement we had when we set up the system.”	

Avery let out a huge sigh, one that reverberated out and left nothing but silence in its wake. “When a big names keep cancelling contracts that means I have to hedge every new one I sign. That costs money. And there's never a guarantee that a new company will pick up the product.”

“Well you should have thought of that when you wanted to enter this market. The nature of the product...” Jessica stopped as if she'd said something wrong.

“Our process is automated! How can customers be so fickle as to not know if and when they need it?”

“You were saying something about the nature of the product, weren't you Jessica?” Shawn said in complete calm after Avery's burst. Jessica wasn't sure which question to answer.

She looked over at Shawn. “You know I know, don't you Shawn?”

“Know what?” asked Avery.

“There was a long contract I had to sign before the new process could get off its feet.”

“But don't you handle this kind of contract Avery?”

“Well, Lars made it a condition that Jessica sign it. She didn't say there was anything wrong with it.”

“If you don't recall, I did object.”

“But you didn't give a reason.”

“And so you acted like I didn't have one. You didn't take time to discuss my doubts. I couldn't explain myself and then money talked louder than my intuition.”

“This sounds,” Shawn noted, “familiar to me.”

“You weren't sure about this from an engineering standpoint?” Jessica asked. The pleasant surprise was apparent in her tone.

“No. What is it that you were bringing up. The nature of the product?”

“The contract I signed included confidentiality clauses. I'm not going to break them.”

“Then just tell us what you can. As an engineer I've never seen so many systems fail and succeed simultaneously. What is the nature of the product, as best you can tell?”

“Well I can't give you any correspondence with specific clients. I can't tell either of you why sales are splattered, because I can't tell you what it is clients are asking for. But...”

Shawn threw out a crumpled piece of paper, a stray uncut confetti piece that he'd yet to file away. “They asking for anything like this?”

Jessica looked at the paper and turned white.

“I'll take that as a yes. No breaking of contract required. Read it.”

“One cannot secure the blessings of freedom without liberty,” she chuckled. “This...” she looked at the paper.

“You don't have to talk about details Jessica. I've been collecting these little sheets. What are they?”

Jessica tried to see if quiet might be her protection. It might have worked with Avery. Shawn was to persuasive.

“If you must know, Shawn Aaron, think about the changes in the process. We used to make party confetti. Now we print words on said confetti. When the customer tosses them out carelessly, what's the difference?”

“Lies. Is that it, lies?”

“No. Lies are cheap. You don't need a factory for that. Fragmentary truth. That's what they want. Truth that's good enough for the moment, and can be forgotten and cleaned up after it's no longer needed. But if it's no longer needed, why buy more of it? That's why the contracts are monthly Avery.”

“What about the ooze?”

“That's still a riddle to me. No one understands. I've heard of other confetti factories quietly shutting their doors despite giving every indication of being financially successful.”

“So this is the nature of the business, Jessica?” Avery asked. “The nature I didn't want to hear about?”

“Yes.”

“Well I'm out,” Avery stated, “I don't care if the money's good. I started my business so I could be my own man, not scramble around trying to please customers whose desires I can't know by contract.”

“What will you do with your shares then,” Shawn asked.

“Sell them to the highest bidder,” Avery responded.

“You mean Lars?”

Avery sighed, “Lars would be the lowest bidder, and he's already gotten a 15% share from me.”

“How did he do that?” Jessica asked. “You've never been one to barter off your shares.”

“It was the only payment he'd take. For the fake independent distribution network that's off the books.”

“This is the first I've heard of it.”

“Like I said, it was off the books. Every cancelled contract I went out and asking for his hedging services. He'd set up some accounting arrangement in exchange for shares. He must have known the nature of the business in advance. In any case I'm ditching my thirty two percent and starting a new company. Why don't you come join me Shawn. It will be like it was.”

“It won't be like it was. I'm staying.”

“What? Why? You have some sort of engineering interest in fragmentary truth?”

“Something is going on here. I have to find out what it is.” He picked up the crumbled sheet of paper.

“What about you Jessica? What will you do with your five percent?”

“I never took that share you offered me, Avery. I just put it in trust with your name on it. It was out in the open, but you never looked.”

“Why would you reject an offer like that?” Avery asked.

“I didn't want to get involved in the business decisions.”

“But you handle the finances. Moreso than ever before.”

“But it doesn't matter. You're leaving right? My salary's better. I have kids to put through college.”

“What about you then Shawn? Whoever takes over the company is obviously going to fire you. Look at the mess in the machines.”

“I still have a share, and if I have anything to say about it, Jessica's going to stay right where she is too, if that's what she wants.”

Avery walked out the door and slammed it shut as though he'd never be back.

“Thank God,” Jessica stated flatly. “I've never liked being in the same room when you two disagreed about business.”

“I see why you sold your share. What are you going to do now? You want to stay here?”

“Yes. Come, here. Let me show you something. I've got a surprise in my desk.”

“Oh?”

“It's very red. Corked away in a graduated cylinder.”

“Samples?”

“Yeah, I went to the trouble of getting some of this stuff for myself.”

“Why?”

“I thought they might be important.”

“Well then,” Shawn replied, “let's make sure they're the real thing.” He opened the cylinder and dipped his uncut confetti strip inside. The print disappeared everywhere the strip was soaked. He pulled it out and capped the cylinder. “Yeah, that's the stuff alright. The paper hasn't changed colors a whit, but the print is gone.”

“What could it be?”

“I don't know. Let's find out.”
