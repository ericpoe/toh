### Older Than Words

"Well," Electra commented as the cramped screen in the room went dim. "So who wanted us to watch that?"

"What do you mean?"

"You didn't have tickets when you came into this place."

"One of the interrogators gave them to me. I think some independent group is invovled."

"HADES?"

"What makes you say that?"

"It was on the tickets."

"Yes, well, HADES seems rather ambivalent about I live. I don't know if I was supposed to survive that interrogation."

"What makes you think there's someone keeping you alive in all this?"

"Why? Was your interrogation mostly... um, nightmares."

"Yes. I'd... rather not discuss it. We still have to get out of here. Cora fell asleep about two minutes into the film."

"Right. Trudging our way out of here. I guess we'll have to ask the old man directions. If we'll even be able to follow them."

"Shouldn't be a problem. Cora?"

"I'm tired. Can't I just sleep mommy?"

"No. We're going home."

"How much longer?"

"In time for you to get a good night's sleep."

"I'm hungry."

"We're all hungry. Just a little further Cora."

"I'll go talk to the old man," Creed announced.

"No, let me," Electra insisted. "I was here once before. You remember the old man?"

"Oh right. You played him in chess, across terminals?"

"Yes, we used the system to mail each other moves. Come on, let's get out of this Theatre while the base personnel are still scratching their heads. Hey! Old man!"

"Yes, Mrs. Samaras," he responded from outside.

"I thought, there was a beach around this base. Does that mine cart go to it?"

"Well yes." he responded. "But no ones gone that way for fifteen or twenty years."

"Perfect. Then there'll be no base personnel to detain us."

"As long as you don't run afoul of the patrols."

"Then that's our route. Let's get on the cart."

"How long is this going to take?" Cora asked impatiently.

"About fifteen minutes missy. Electra, you sure you can find your way about once you get out."

"I have the geography memorized. I just hope I can turn all those squiggles on the map to actual directions."

"Why would you have that memorized?"

"I was thinking of running away. I was about thirteen or fourteen. But enough of memory lane. Into the cart!" 

Electra forced the rusty door and it squealed its way open. Creed, Electra and Cora huddled together with the driver in a space meant for two people. They barely noticed the scrunching to the feeling of heat for each other's bodies. 

Questions bubbled in Creed's head. How was Electra sure she'd been to this base before? But there were a great number of conspicuous features about it. It was built over an abandoned mine, and apparently Electra's father had helped install the computer system, which Electra used, and based on the duration of their trip from where they started, and Electra's likely knowledge of local roads, she must have been able to have pieced a location together.

That there should be a secret, unguarded passage to the base worked its way out in Creed's head too. The Theatre, and possibly the mine, were still active and being run by HADES, whilst the base obscured the facilities and must also have been built with a more modern purpose (at least as far as the former Soviets were concerned). The party must have had the grace of HADES but the ire of the military. 

This was a point of contention he'd have to resolve in his mind. His travels had given him the impression that all the strangeness he'd experienced somehow traced back to HADES and not a conventional military. Here was the military trying to imprison him, and HADES keeper of the keys letting him slip out undetected. He'd have some questions for Electra when this daring escape was over.

Creed watched the rafters the remaining portion of the ride. The seemed made of wood, but he noticed flecks of writhing earth coiling around them. Worms and he knew what other carrion seemed to be making them their home. But there structure didn't seemed to be giving way. Creed guess they might have been reinforcements."

The cart hit a fat puddle of water and made a roaring splash. Water brakes. It was the end of the line. Everyone filed out of the cart and the three escapees towards a small tunnel. Creed hoped to see light pouring in, but he had no idea what time it would be when last he exited the facility. 

The night was clear, and Creed observed Electra fixed intently on the stars. After about a minute's reflection, she said "That way!" and pointed. Creed wondered if Electra's father had taught her to navigate by the stars. He seemed a rather dangerous man, if he were still alive. Electra must have had a rocky relationship, if she had planned to run away in her teen years.

"Hurry up Creed!" Electra shook him from his thoughts.

"This mud we're trudging through isn't stable. We're going to get stuck."

"We're going to get stuck in the mud or the back of a military truck. Your call. The public beach is about a mile and a half from here, I know it. Almost there. Come on, Cora, keep up."

"You're sure you know the way?"

"Yes, now move your ass!" 

Creed trudged on, into the twilight that was emerging. That rare bit of light right before the sunrise he sometimes say when taking a break from grading papers. There wasn't a soldier or armed truck anywhere. The first lights of a sleepy town seemed to be flickering on. The mud gave way to harder ground and a stretch of sand. It appeared they had at last, as predicted, come out the way the came in, via public beach. No one had hit the sands this early, but the sun's first red light came with the promise of warmth. 

The group had no food, no money, and no passports, a situation that didn't alarm Electra in the slightest. A few food carts and cafes bordered the beach, and as the wondered the neighboring town food kept appearing in his hands from Electra's fingers. She had, no doubt, lived on the streets during a part of her ventures. After some persistent begging she rounded up enough money to call an isolated pay phone, maybe the only one in town. She argued in soft, sultry tones with what seemed to be a Russian phone operator after an exchange of a few words, put the phone back down. It then rang and she picked it up.

"Yes. Yes alert. Extraction, if you can believe it. No, out in the open. Three guidebooks needed. Umm... hold on." Electra put the phone down. "When we left to go swimming, did you take your passport with you?" She asked Creed.

"I think I left it in the apartment."

Electra picked up the phone, "One guidebook at homebase. The other two freshly printed, for the elder and the younger. Five miles south southwest of the Old Mine Basements. ETA? Alright." Then Electra hung up the phone. 

"What was that all about?" Creed asked.

"Well, we're stuck here until passports can get smuggled across the border. It shouldn't be too hard, a passport's easy to conceal. We should be out of here by nightfall. There might even be time for a nap. I wouldn't mind if you 'forgot' about that phone call by the way."

"Not like I could understand half of it anyway."

"Well, I'm going to have to whip up a story about this for my contacts, and it would help my cover if they just thought you were some dumb and bumbling American tourist. I know better, but sometimes it helps to play into people's prejudices. It might help for you to pretend you don't know Greek, depending on who they send."

This explanation really did answer many questions for Creed, other than some folks were going to show up and he would look like an outsider to them. He moved to find some shade, and fell asleep in the sand until he was jostled away several hours later. There were hands on his arm and they were not female, but gruff and huge. They were attached to a gruff and huge man whose trim beard looked familiar.

"Ali?" he asked.

"Yes, it's me Creed." he replied. "Get up."

Creed scuffled to his feet and his eyes adjusted to the evening light. He was hungry, but spotted foil surrounding what he hoped was a packaged meal.

"I didn't think I'd ever see you again," Creed told him, stumbling towards the direction that held promise of a vehicle.

"Yeah, me neither. But I'm working on a story, a human story that is. Can't tell you the details I'm afraid. Join me in the car?"

Creed followed Ali to the car, noting Electra in the back seat, already asleep. Ali followed promptly and turned on the engine.

"Electra said you were quite helpful in this debacle," Ali merged back on to the road.

"Oh, well I think she did most of the work really."

"They let you go."

"Well, it seems to me two organizations were involved. One of them let us go."

"What got you picked up in the first place? Just your location at the beach?"

"Didn't you hear about the fiasco? The jellyfish swarm, the fatalities?"

"It... hasn't been on the news, but that doesn't really say much, does it? I know how flaky the news cycle can be. So, a swarm of jellyfish, a couple of days ago?"

"They marched up to the beach stinging everything in sight before collapsing into glistening puddles."

"Where they red? You know like in Ooze From the Confetti Factory?"

"No. But I've seen, what, 5 films so far, and they all have this, indescribable muck. Any ideas?"

"Not really. I tried really hard to relate specifics to the film I saw. But the more I try, the more I like looser interpretations. Metaphors that hold for a scene before disappearing. I was quite impatient with that approach when I saw the film. But I think I like grinding away at it over time than an over-arching explanation.

"That's always my job, you know, as a journalist. An overarching explanation. An expert opinion. A key to mashing the details together. But humans, well we just sort of add another day on to our mess of half-forgotten days. Is there an answer. I find myself less certain the older I get.

"Of course there's one institution that prizes certainty and abhors doubt, mortally."

"Who?"

"The military. Who knows, maybe that's why you got picked up."

"Their interrogation wasn't exactly rigorous. Well, that's not true. It was quite potent. Just not the kind you'd expect if a military thought you were spies or agents or whatever. I tell you though, there were two factions. One wanted us caught and one didn't seem to think we belonged there."

"Well, it's hard to tell what a good military is really thinking. It's hard to fight what you don't understand."

"Yeah, I know. That's what I've been wondering. Am I fighting HADES and its earthly incarnation of Theatres? Or am I just along for the ride?"

"You better hope you're just along for the ride. Military intelligence is a living nightmare."

"You survived it."

"Hmm. Didn't even have to tell you. They try to turn you into nothing. You're not a person to them. You're an idea or a contact. You're an explanation or a lead. And anything attached to that lead, you know like a body, a social creature, a mind, is forfeit. But I didn't rat on anyone."

"How did you get out?"

"I count myself lucky. There's no telling when some official will think you're not valuable enough to keep, and not dangerous enough to shoot. Electra's father set it up."

"He did?"

"Don't go mentioning too much to the lady. She was about 18 or 19. She ran away from him. He sent me to look after her. Unobtrusively. I think this is the first scrape she really needed my help for though."

--------------------------------

Ali dropped Creed and Electra off at her apartment, promising to get Cora to a doctor he knew that would be discrete. They were both a little woozy from their combined sleep, but there minds rested enough for conversation.

"I don't think I like this Theatre of HADES of yours. You can count me out of any more of your films." Electra announced.

"This last adventure take you to far down memory lane? It's ok. I had problems with my old man too."

"Problems? What problems?" Electra sighed. "Ok, there were problems. My father loved me very much. He just, put a burden on me. Nearly broke me, to be honest."

"What burden?"

"Well, dad did intelligence. I wasn't going to tell you but well, you ran into too many of his old friends. Dad didn't trust any intelligence officer he ever met. I know how very lonely he was. He trusted his daughter though. He really needed an adult to meet with, not a child. So he, taught me things. He was going to turn his child into an adult see, the friend he really needed. He didn't really know how to go about doing it. I think he had a plan though. He walked me through the parts of his job he thought it was safe for me to learn. C, Unix, Chess. But he worked long days and I had to stay in the confines of his quarters. 

"All day to myself and lots of computer advice, you can imagine how quickly I became a computer whiz. And he was really quite ecstatic about it. He could have full blown discussions about computers with his twelve year old daughter. But I was trapped, always in the supposed safety of that room of his, bounded by four walls. You have no idea what it was like."

Creed took Electra's hands in his. "I think I have a very clear picture. Stuck as I was at my small town's public library."

"Oh?" Electra withdraw her hands and placed them behind her back.

"A small religious town like my home town has walls of its own. Mental walls."

"Explain."

"Faith... no that's not the right term. Faith, on a collective level, orthodoxy might be what I'm thinking of. Well, in Christianity faith is a part of being a good person. Nobody says it, but everyone has their definition of what faith means. But if you question faith, well then you question righteousness. So you can't go into length on doubt because someone's idea of faith gets step on, and then you get stepped on. So you end up hemmed in, not really knowing what's considered ok to believe and not knowing what to think. But you were always given the impression that you're doing something wrong you have to hide. There were secular books at the library and no one questioned my intent in reading them."

"A very different kind of prison," Electra responded. "Why don't I pull out some of my spare military food stuffs and light a few candles around here? The overhead light is a little glaring at the moment."

"Sure," Creed responded. It would give him a little time to collect his thoughts. He sat down by the small wooden table in her kitchen while she scrambled for the can opener.

"Hmph." Electra mumbled to herself as she went through cabinets. "You know how I said Dad made sure I learned chess?"

"I remember."

"Well, he wanted me safe from his world. From espionage. I couldn't get out of his room. But sometimes he would stay in a military base or embassy with a computer in his room, usually an internal system. It was easy to arrange chess games on those systems, and you could play with pseudonyms. So I could play games, and no one could tell it was a little girl handing their asses to them. Dad never questioned a chess game. It really wasn't a replacement for human contact. But when it was mind-to-mind like that, I didn't feel so alone. It was the same way when Dad helped me with my C programs."

"And that little relief built up over time didn't it?" Creed looked up into Electra's eyes and held them for some moments, and Electra suddenly looked down and away.

"Yes."

"And I turned eighteen. Passed high school. I could go to college and I could leave home. I didn't have to hide my doubt, my curosity, my sense of wonder, any more. The freedom was intoxicating."

"Intoxicating?" Electra looked down and tended to her meal.

"Surely you know the feeling. You left your dad at some point didn't you. The one who brought such passion and despair?"

Electra dropped her fork, and pushed herself away from the table.

"I'm being too forward, aren't I?" Creed asked.

"No. I'm being too backward. If you take my meaning. I ran away too. He was a cryptographer. He was built. Dad kept me away for so long. It's different for a woman to run off. Now Cora doesn't have a father."

"Were you heart-broken?"

"You talk about any of this to anyone and I swear I'll kill you," she replied, stab her fork into processed meat. She determined to meet his eyes this time. Creed could feel pressure to look away, but did not.

"Thanks for looking after Cora," Electra added, trying to change the subject.

"Well it was only natural. Our lives were in danger. What kind of man would I be if I abandoned her?"

"Right. Of course." she replied. She was a bit scared to add anything else. She didn't know what to make of Creed at the moment. He was in his thirties, single, never married. An obscure intellectual in some American province with which she wasn't familar. All this suggested, based on her long experience of dealing with technical men, that he was horrible with women. So why now did she feel this pull? She was reminded of impending checkmates from her years of experience.

She tried to eat her dinner. But it was difficult to look away from him. She had been given that Blood of Apollo that she was certain both Creed and her daughter had been given. He seemed almost to anticipate the content of her vision, the fatal choice she had been offered. He was never be able to have guessed the contents of her hallucination, but the choice she had made. Did he guess it?

Creed ate the rest of his meal in silence, which did nothing to soothe her tension. He did not rush his meal, despite how hungry he must have been. She ate when he did, trying to hide the fact that she was not hungry. They thus finished at the same time, and got up to put the waste away at the same time. This caused them to be inches away from each other. Painfully close.

Creed did not anticipate this and moved an inch or two back with a start. This was the moment for a kiss. Only the most anxiety ridden dolt would have turned down something like this, unless he didn't want it. But it became clear that Creed did want it, without reason or restraint.

"I've spent so many years," Creed uttered, "letting other people tell me what I do and don't get. Not this year. Not this time."

"Take me," she whispered, "take me." 

He unbuttoned her shirt, saving the last button to rip from its tether. He went to unclasp her bra, but before he got there, he felt teeth in his shoulder.

"You... bit me!" he exclaimed. Electra merely giggled, and went for a second swipe, which Creed dodged. He tried to pin her to the floor to protect himself. She wriggled under his grip, her sweat making her increasingly harder to grapple. So deflected his attempts with apparent ease, though he reapplied himself until he'd had grab of both of her wrists. 

"I don't surrender when I make love," she whispered deliciously. It became clear he would have to take her, to claim her. She was a smart and beautiful woman, sweaty and alive. He felt a more sinister feeling for her flood his veins, something heart stopping and tender at the same time. In what little time he had to think, he felt he would have pursued women with a little more zest, if he had known it could be like this.

Electra finally not only broke completely free, she spotted a weakness in Creed's balance and rolled him over, not quite winding him, but sprawling him on his back. She was on top now, where she wanted to be, in control. She unclasped her bra while he took off his shirt, and in the tangle of clothes bit him on the upper arm.

"I'm going to get you for that bitch," Creed retorted. He had never called a woman a name in bed, but it seemed the proper step to take in this dance.

"My bitch," Electra corrected. "Call me my bitch."

He went to unzip her jeans, but she pushed his hand out of the way and removed her jeans and panties with one full swoop. Creed unzipped his jeans, and then Electra grabbed hold of his member and slid down on it. He let out an involuntary moan as she took him in. He considered throwing her around, but found a certain satisfaction that every thrusting motion was going to be against the whole weight of her body. He anticipated she would grab him for balance, but she held her arms outward like a gymnast and rolled her body with Creed. 

Sweat dripping from his forehead, a trickle of blood on his shoulder, rolling against Electra's hips, Creed climaxed, almost throwing Electra off until he grunted against her weight one last time. Gasping for breath he told Electra, "No one's been that rough with me before."

"American women must make poor lovers. I adore the determination men have in their eyes when the love isn't easy and comes with a price." Electra did seem to show any will to move, even though by now she was crushing Creed's hips.

"Roll off me for God's sakes," Creed complained.

"If you insist," she curled up to Creed's ear to continue there chat.

"That's my bitch," he thanked her.

"I would have thought a reserved professor like you would have been a little more timid in bed."

"Something took over. Something old and instinctive and hungry. Just took over my body."

"Yes, yes. Something much older than those words you put so much stock in."

Creed twirled Electra's thick black curls. He had always had a soft spot for dark hair since his first arrival in Greece. There had been a few unforgetable girls from that era. He'd been afraid to approach any of them. Playing with Electra's hair he asked, "So that girl that ran from her prison, did she get what she was hoping for?" He had wondered about the wisdom of a post-coitus conversation but couldn't muster the strength to stop one that had clearly started.

"Umm... no. I didn't want to keep Cora locked away as I have, but it's been too dangerous not to. I want her to have net pals, but she needs to stay in anonymous chatrooms and those are more for, adults."

"Well what about for you?"

"What about me? I became a hacker, just like Dad taught me to be. What about you?"

"I exchanged one dogma for another. Faith for academic rigor. It doesn't really control what I think. But it controls what I publish, and as a professor that pretty controls the rest of me. I mean, if I go back to being a professor that is."

"I make enough money. You could be my... servant I suppose."

"You don't date servants."

"You have me there professor," she replied, poking his nose. "But can we go back to what we were doing, after what we've seen."

"Well," Creed offered, "what are we to do about it, precisely. These scenes have had two witnesses, well three depending, but still just us. We go back to what we were doing until we can bring these anomalies to focus." 

"What about that ticket you still have?"

"What about it?"

"Well, you had that ticket when you came here and you picked up two pair along the way. When did you get it?"

"You know, it's funny. I got this one first. But every time a Theatre comes around, another ticket shows up. And I think this ticket is for one."

"The last piece missing in the puzzle."

"You're the last piece."

"Oh?"

"Everything I was missing. It's right here."

"That's just your penis talking."

"You were worth the trip. Say, why don't you come to America instead of me staying here."

"I live here."

"Boarded up in your room, scared of Russian para-military kidnapping your daughter. There's some pockets of small town America where you'll never be found."

"Like um, that Omaha in the film?"

"It's not really full of the military agents you saw in the film."

"But my contacts and passports."

"You don't really need passports in plenty of America. It's a thousand miles of America in every direction some places."

"Give me some time."
