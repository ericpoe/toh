Synopsis: Creed and Electra return from the film, both shaken for their own reasons. Creed because he has met Margot, Electra for reasons not mentioned. The pledge a day of relaxation, only to have it interrupted by a horde of rainbow manowar that march towards the shore where they've been swimming. Creed makes the decision to hold Cora above water (whether that's really necessary isn't stated) rather than flee. For some reason, of which there are only hints, the things leave them alone and sting everyone else to death.

Upon the end of the film, Creed said very little. The Margot who had kept him company on the way to Vegas was the same as the one of the film, of these he was sure. She had arrived sopping wet with little on her person and may very well have been fleeing the crime scene when he had stopped to pick her up. Most disturbing was, unlike Phoenix or his hospital roommates, she had been seen by someone else, Ali, who could attest to her identity.

Electra spoke little as well. In a state of frantic conjecture he wondered if perhaps Electra had perhaps come across a General Dobson, but he shook it from his mind. The Theatre of HADES did not seem to be an institution that lended itself to symmetry. The silence was getting a bit irksome, no a bit--guilty. Creed thought he at least ought to start some general discussion of the film without revealing particulars.

"Wow, so uh... who knows what we'll really do, in extraordinary circumstances?" He asked.

"Yes, who knows?" Electra said reflexively. It wasn't the kind of response one could build on.

"I particularly like the suggestions of the purposes of memory. How often should we be reminded of our failures, or successes for that matter?"

"Memory has its place. I really ought to go home no, I think. My daughter might be worried."

"Yes. That sounds excellent. Except, well I don't have much by way of cash to find some place to sleep."

"Are you asking to spend the night with me?" she asked.

"It would be preferable to the streets."

Electra looked him over. She seemed to have anticipated this, but must have had something in the back of mind. "Sleeping under the sky fortifies one's constitution," Electra declared. Creed did not completely hear a no in that response, only a suggestion that one might be coming. The pair went back for the night bus.

Electra said little, had a frowning demeanor, but eventually asked him a question, "These tickets of yours. Why do you think you have gotten a hold of them? In the multiple. I can tell you've gotten them before."

"I haven't been able to reason an answer out for you."

"Then if your brain doesn't have an answer, what does your heart tell you?"

"They don't seem to arrive except to someone who wants to open themselves up to something. While, that's not strictly accurate. They have come to people with idle curiosity, or people that don't want them... but the don't tend to stay in the possession of those people. Most tickets seemed to have been given to me, like a gift."

"Gift? Some gift."

"I never said they were necessarily a good gift. But I think something or someone wants to give them."

"You have any idea who that might be?"

"Someone connected with the land of the dead, but separate somehow. Nothing escapes the land of the dead, I keep hearing. Someone neither living nor dead. I..."

"Yes?"

"I don't really know what I'm saying. I'm tired, very tired."

"Then tomorrow you would look forward to a day of relaxation?"

"Tomorrow I'd like not to have a care in the world."

"Then you might find your situation most congenial. I promised to take Cora to the beach."

"This... shipment of computer parts can wait."

"Well if it's not even real in the first place, I should imagine it need not give the slightest consideration to time."

"Well ok then," Creed responded, as if the comment was self-evidently rational. After having so much contact with unreality, it seemed more like the objects could pick and choose which rules to follow, based entirely on whim. There was no rule that the necessarily be timeless.

"Wake me up at the bus stop," Creed instructed Electra. He intended on getting some sleep, but he closed his eyes and his still weary brain was nonetheless filled with speculations. Something in the Garden of Treason had unnerved Electra, that was to be certain. Though she certainly seemed inclined to give him a place to stay, she didn't seem eager about the arrangement. 

There were easy explanations to these phenomena. If Electra had been a hacker concerned with disrupting the military, the movie had a hundred reasons why it might bother her. For one, it featured the corruption of an innocent into a murderer. It also featured a character in mourning for the loss of her child. Electra was into something dangerous, and had a little one in her charge. 

So too, there might be a hundred reasons for his uneasiness of him spending the night. She didn't know him well. Was he going to be a determined loafer, that slept on her couch for the next six months? Was he, who had brought her this strange ticket, to be trusted in the same house as her daughter? Was there a husband, or significant other, waiting to get into a fight over?

Or were there questions of unreality to be concerned with as well. These feverish conjectures frightened him the most. In this bout of imagining he did something he had not done in a rather long time. He imagined himself in conversation with his uncle, and trying to guess at what his advice might be. "Occam's Razor, my boy, Occam's Razor. Off all the nonsense your brain has spouted, can any simpler motive be found in Electra's actions than fear of the uncertain and unfamiliar?"

"Trust..." Creed whispered, and Electra shook him. 

"Our stop," she told him. Watching Creed struggle to his feet. "Your trip has taken a bit out of you, hasn't it?" she asked.

"Yes."

"Well we've not far to walk," she said, taking his hand and guiding him through the alleyways. They were not well lit, and Electra must have had memory illuminate part of the way. Electra reached for her keys, and with some force wrenched the door forward. The hinges needed to be oiled at least. 

"I don't suspect that woke Cora."

"She could sleep through an atomic blast. Still, I think I better check on her," Electra went in for a minute, and came out looking for a ratty looking rag, with paint flecks here and there on its surface. A minute or two later she came back with the rag, which had fresh paint on it. When Electra noticed Creed's curiosity she mentioned, "She's been finger-painting. Must have fallen asleep without washing her hands."

"Oh," Creed did not say the word with much strength, but Electra seemed eager to qualify.

"She's old enough to start using a brush, I think, but she seems to be just as fascinated by the feeling of painting that she hasn't really given it a try. It's messy, but children need their independence I think, so I remind her for the dozenth time to wash her hands."

Whilst she was clearing this up, Creed was negotiating with Electra's couch. It was a hideous brown and the upholstery was rough, but it sunk well with Creed's weight. No doubt it had been purchased at some second hand shop without a consideration for color, or maybe it had been left their by the previous home's owner. Creed fell asleep almost instantaneously, but he could swear, before he did so, a blanket being stretched over him. 

--------------------------------------

Creed awoke with a great yawn, to find Electra and Cora already in swimwear, eating breakfast and waiting on him. Creed pulled the blanket off and went into the combination kitchen and dining area. Electra merely offered Creed breakfast, but Cora looked away in distress and seemed to be contemplating running to the porch. She was about three feet tall and was likely six or seven, but it had been some time that Creed had been around children. Her hair seemed thicker and blacker than her mother's.

"She's very shy," Electra told him, "and she can tell you're a foreigner."

"Don't worry," Electra spoke softly. "He's not one of those men. He's from America."

Creed didn't understand the tact she was talking, but grabbed what was left of breakfast. He ate at a leisurely pace, which he soon noted irritated his companions. He realized that despite having all day there might still be impatience involved, at least until he got to the beach. There too was the added delay of getting some kind of swimming trunks. Creed was living out of a suitcase and swimming trunks were not in the basic necessities. So he bought a brown pair at a local clothing boutique and donned them. 

The sun was out high now, and the beach reasonably attended. Creed took off his sandals only to remember how well the sun scorched the sand. Creed moved with urgency before placing a towel and looking back. Electra's hair seemed to soak in every last ray of the sun except for a few shining streaks. She was, now that he could she her fully in the bright light, a bit more tan than he realized. 

He had always loved tanned skin. It seemed stronger, more robust, more sensuous. It seemed a little bit like fruit when it had ripened just so. Electra wore a black one piece bathing suit, and he could see a waist and hips for the first time. Electra was long and slender but not delicate. Some muscles lay here and there, though he was unable to take more of her in without staring. 

Electra and Cora strolled down to where Creed had setup his towel and placed theirs side-by-side. They took their own shoes off, and Electra slipped a bill in hers, presumably for lunch. 

"How far do you think you can make it, Cora?" Electra asked. 

Given Electra would be distracted with her daughter for a while, Creed ran down the shore. He left a trail of thick prints in the sand, then, reaching the waves he continued, until the weight of the water knocked his legs out from under him and he plunged into the water.

He was in the Aegean Sea again, for the first time in six years. He had hoped to reach it without putting his academic future in jeopardy, but it was still a great comfort all the same. He'd read no more tales of Odysseus's' great sea-borne adventures whilst landlocked in the Midwest. Making his home here, he thought, might have some difficulties, but Electra didn't seem to unnerved by his presence at breakfast. He must not have been that much of a burden to put up. He needn't worry he thought. He just lay on his back and floated in the waves, not sinking in the saltwater as he would have at home. Things could be real, things could be unreal. What did it matter. The sun, he thought, was shining. 

A pair of hands pulled at him and knocked him out of his reverie. His hips fell down into the water, and he looked around. It was Cora, the so-called shy one. She must, Creed thought, have watched him run to the sea like a child and wanted in on the fun. He had thoughts of dunking her in response, but he was to nervous to do so. With mom looking on he didn't quite know what was ok and what wasn't. Seeing as how she was learning to swim, he decided to brace his arms against the bottom of the shallows and kick in demonstration. Cora eagerly imitated, for a while, and he looked up at Electra, who was smiling.

"You can go a little deeper," Electra told her. "Just remember to kick off the bottom if you can't stay up." Then she looked at Creed. "Go on, you're a teacher,"

"I don't want her to fall asleep he protested, but put his face into rather shallow water and turned around. The brine dried his eyes and mouth as he did so, but he did not mind. It brought back more carefree memories. Cora followed, but not able to keep up with Creed's pace. He turned around, stood in the waist deep water and walked back while she struggled towards him. She caught up with when the water reached his hips. He held her up for a bit. "You've got to kick, that's where the strength comes from. Kick."

She seemed to grow tired after a while and Creed demonstrated holding one's breath. Whimsically, he clenched his nostrils shut with his fingers and crossed his eyes before going under. Cora ducked her head down for an instant, but straightened herself soon afterwards. The water still hadn't reached anywhere near her height, and Creed thought they should go out a little further.

He turned to look out into the bay, and it seemed the sun had scattered into a thousand pieces, so bright where the scattered waves. But the specks did not remain white. They shifted from pink to red to green. He wasn't quite sure what he was looking at, but instantly grasped some unreal thing with going on, and he would have to figure out what to do.

When the specks became bulbs and he could see the bulbs had tentacles he realized he was not dealing with floating rainbow blobs, but a horde of manowar. They seemed to be moving at great speed and with intent. He based on their speed, he did not think he could outrun them. He imagined a sting that might paralyze a limb and last for weeks, should the tentacles latch onto him. Not so for Cora, who might be dead. Before he even knew what he was doing, he swam straight to the water and plucked Cora out of it.

"Put me down," she giggled.

Her giggling stopped when she heard a shrill scream erupt from the other side of the beach. Reflexively, she wriggled to try to see what was going on, but Creed gripped tighter. The many lights simmered out, briefly, and then came back as dazzling as ever. Blues and oranges, reds and yellows--all pale and bright. A portion flickered again, and more screaming and gasps of pain came from various quarters of the beach.

"What's happening?" she asked.

"I don't know. The water's not safe for you."

"What about you?" she pleaded.

"It's ok," Creed told her. "I'm protected." This was a flat out lie, but Creed didn't think the lie would matter much if he were wrong. The things were, in fact, moving right by. He felt feelers, thick noodles with spiky skin, protruding through the waters. The skin gave way to viscous muscle that felt cold and smooth and metallic. As Creed down at the beasts it looked like mercury surrounded by fibrous tissue.

He craned his neck to see Electra, hoping to see her safe at shore. But she had been behind them, in the water, not moving. She had to have guessed by now that the shore meant safety, but she wasn't moving. He wanted to cry out to save herself at least, but she seemed frozen still, waiting to see if she were going to have to jump in and take Creed's place if he dropped her. She noticed him looking over at her, and couldn't decide if her eyes were screaming, "Tell me it's all right" or "Don't you dare."

The manowar were closing in on her, and she likewise, seemed protected. Had somehow their presence in the Theatre helped them? Had maybe these things smelled something and decided they were dead? Had they any connect with the strange plants he had so recently seen? His mind was racing for answers.

No answers seemed forthcoming, and he felt it better to appreciate strength and courage and hadn't expected. Cora cried and begged, but her sobs were coming in longer intervals, like she was resigning herself to doing nothing. Without fail everyone not able to make it to the beach was stung to death. 

Then the stench reached the air. It was bitter and metallic, as if it were not manowar headed towards shore, but floating sacks of mercury. They seemed to burst with a slight pop, such that the beach seemed sprinkled with dozens of muted fireworks. The searing light, which seemed to intensify the sun rather than merely reflect it, seemed to have hidden the numbers of this swarming army, or this rebellion, or this exodus, Creed couldn't decide which. 

Was there even this much life in the sea? Creed wondered, for he had never seen much more than a few large fish in the water, even in his time on the islands as an undergrad. Cora stopped seeming like a child to be carried then a pile of boulders to be hauled. As the horde continued she began to feel more like lead, but every so often one of the feelers would seem to prick a little harder than usual, stiffening his body and easing the weight.

As all the lights had faded from the water to the shore, Creed put Cora down and started pulling her to shore. But over the last crackle from the last dead manowar he could hear sirens, and new it was too late. Perhaps civilian and medical personnel were called to the beach; it did not matter. The military was here as well, ready to apprehend them. If he had any hopes of running, they were dashed when he could see an audience on the beach, pointing.
