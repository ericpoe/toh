Synopsis: Jonathon, now under full sway of wanting to solve the riddle of HADES, is off to St. Louis on rather flimsy evidence. Anxious to clear up an old family rumor, he asked his uncle Walter about the sexual indescretion that his father was so affronted by. That down, Creed tries to solve the problem by thinking too hard, and Walter takes both the role of skeptic (regarding HADES) and the one to tell Creed to just calm down.

"Well, Jonny my boy, you definitely know how to rouse a profesor's attention," Walter said as he entered the car. "I just got out of my Thursday class, but I need to be back by Monday. Is there anything else in the world that needs illuminating?"

"There is an unsolved riddle from the past I've never gotten to ask you about."

"Oh?"

"This story of you sleeping with a student."

"Oh. Ms. Borroughs. What do you want to know?"

"I heard that story many times growing up. I didn't hear any details that might have spoken in your favor."

"Well, she was a brilliant physics major. Not stunning, but pretty. She really found the history of her subject interesting, and came to my office a lot. So it was a Friday evening, we shared some wine, and I put my hand on her thigh. The attraction was mutual, we fucked and just kept it hush hush. It was her senior year, she graduated, and we had one delicious summer together. She got pregnant, I took care of her bills, she got through her doctorate, and then married another physicist. She had two more kids."

"You seem awfully matter of fact about it."

"It was a while back. These things happen Jonny. We had fun, I was too busy to be a father, but took responsibility for what I did. I mean, a new group of women in their early twenties every semester? A guy can be forgiven for slipping once, can't he?"

"Well, not according to dad."

"Your dad. I can't imagine what it must have been like being raised by him. Human sexuality has never fit into a neat package and it never will. Hell, just get on the Internet for Christ's sake... figure of speech there Jonny."

"Well, it's more than that. There's always been something more between you and dad then the pious Christian and the secular intellectual."

"Occam's razor, always prefer the simplest answer. It was love. Your grandmother yearned to go to college, but those were different days. Not going to college herself so she was interested in her sons... both her sons, I might add, going to school. I got highest honors, your father couldn't make it through seminary. We had always been tense, siblings usually are. But I think the tears of happiness after I got into not just college but graduate school. I think that's what clinched it. Your father can blame religion all he wants."

"You sound so calm when you say this."

"History of science, that's what my life's been about for decades. I guess there were other ways I could have gone though. This damn ticket. What kind of movie you think they'd show there, if we found it?"

"I haven't the slightest idea. I mean, the circumstances of getting my ticket..."

"Whatcha thinking there Jonny?"

"I was given a ticket, but I also found a ticket. My original, regarding the documents, is still on me."

"Oh?"

"Well I was going to suggest maybe the film might have something to do with those documents that disappeared. But I guess I wouldn't know."

"Some film. A show we don't know in a Theatre we can't find."

"I think the searching process is important. We should look for a break. Two things that don't fit together."

"Like what?"

"I don't know."

"Well, long as you don't know, why don't we just turn on NPR and I enjoy a long ride with my nephew?"

"Maybe a little later. I need to think. We must be looking for something viscous. Something that sticks to things."

"Like syrup?"

"Maybe."

"Mercury?"

"Hmm..."

"What Jonny boy? Blood, tar oil, honey?"

"All good guesses. I guess we'll have to keep an eye out in St. Louis."

----------------------------------

"So, Jonny, we're in St. Louis. You haven't any ideas?"

"This Theatre isn't straight-forward uncle."

"Well, thanks for switching it back to NPR when you got stumped. Just a nice lazy car ride. You come to appreciate the simple things as you get older."

"I'll tell you when that happens."

"How'd you find the damn thing last time?"

"There was a discrepancy. A discrepancy between recorded and actual fact."

"Well, we're in luck then. Two historians ought to have a good eye for that kind of thing."

"Quit joking."

"Semi-joking. We don't know what we're doing, but it will all seem obvious in retrospect."

"It was medical records last time. I was hospitalized with a rare illness and the documents didn't match my condition."

"Wouldn't that information be confidential."

"Someone hacked the hospital and found out about it."

"Great. Know any hackers?"

"Would you stop that?"

"You're not taking this seriously."

"I am. You're grasping at straws, and I'm making it clear."

"You've grasped at straws before, haven't you?"

"Yes. I just, I've never seen you so anxious Jonny. You're going to have to think clearly to solve this."

"Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. There's got to be a puzzle, a riddle, a metaphor that's out of place."

"But you don't haven't even a grasp of what kind of metaphor?"

"I... I'm having a hard time explaining aren't I? I want you working with me."

"Then sell me on your approach. If you can't explain an idea, it's not clear enough in your head to act on."

"I'm not so sure you're right about that. I just... have you ever... Sometimes, as a professor, I've come across some rather original writing. Something with nerve, something bold. And I've knocked those papers down. Not enough evidence. Pooring reasoning. Haven't you ever felt you've let a genius paper slip through because it didn't follow the assignment?"

"Uggh. Yes. I do worry about that sort of thing. But look at it from my point of view. Science is an accrued body of knowledge. Knowledge responsible for so much wonder in the world. I've seen too many leeches try to apply a thin veneer of science to their poor reasoning and sell it on unsuspecting dupes."

"But I've seen the Theatre of HADES with my own eyes!"

"How? You say its connected to some enigma, something sticky and unresolved. But you're... I think you're trying to outsmart it. But you don't outsmart enigmas. If you want to find out if there's something strange in the city, why don't you just read the damn newspaper?"

"That's a great idea uncle. Let's just sit down and read the newspaper."

"I'll get us some coffee. We might see what there is to do in this town other than visiting the Arch."

Dr. Creed pulled out some change, and picked up the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, along with a few free publications and zines, when happened to be close to the coin opearted distributors. He sat down at an outdoor cafe and went straight to the opinion section. Given the last film he expected a botched sentence or two in an opinion piece. But in the end, it was really just opinions of the day. A little more refined than backdoor gossip, but still, what people felt, rather than what they knew. 

There was a press conference from the mayor's office, a fatal shooting, a status report on a controversial construction project. He read the last one with great interest. Controversy seemed something the Theatre was all about, and construction might lead to an unusual location. After picking it clean, noting and writing down the officials involved, he quit the story in frustration. The local politics and businesses were a bore. So to were the stories about economics and the biographies of local families. Someone rescued his pet snake from a toilet, which was an amusing image, but left no traces. 

The paper quickly devolved to advertising. That was worth taking a look at. Admittedly, you really spent much of your life trying to filter out advertising, so examining it directly, particularly if you didn't have the urge to buy anything, felt awkward. The visual design skills of the ads were notably impressive--design to grab the eye, though more with style than substance. 

Continuing to crawl through the last bits of the newspaper revealed something he hadn't thought to look for. The obituaries. This was promising. If there was going to be some strange, overlooked discrepancy, something to do with death, well the obituaries were a good start. They weren't particularly entertaining as no one of note seemed to have died, so the method here lay in finding the discrepancy. 

Finding a discrepancy in an obituary would take some patience. Much of what an obituary consisted of was a listing of all the positives in a life to please the friends and relatives of those purchasing the paper. Creed read them all. He wondered if he'd have to contact the various authorities for death certificates and hospital records. Go through time, cause, and location of death. It was a dizzying prospect though. His uncle's claims that he was grasping at straws came back to him. 

But as he was focusing on committing names and causes of death to memory, he ran across something that puzzled him. The obituary of a one Robert Friedman, numerologist, who had been stabbed outside the Rio de Oculto bookstore. This struck him as strange because he would have thought the paper would have mentioned a fatal stabbing much closer to the front page. 

He showed the entry to his uncle Walter for a second opinion. Walter replied that sometimes, in morbid interest, he followed the latest writings of "kooks and quacks". He justified this interest on the grounds that he was curious as to the motivation of trying to turn science back into mythology and thus reverse it's progress. He had not heard Friedman, who had apparently written 12 books on the subject, covering such topics as Nostradamus' prophecies, The numerological implications of the work of the Free Masons, and numerological biograhpy of Edgar Cayce and his prophecies of regarding the continent of Atlantis. This last part Walter pointed out to Creed.

"Guess you won't have to disprove this guy on a television show, huh? Hey, don't sweat it, death is a fiercer adversary." It was a little morbid for his uncle. But this really felt right, and it provided a place to look, the Rio de Oculto bookstore. They got back into Creed's car and Walter reached for his smart phone, and googled the store.

"You know how to run one of those things?" Creed asked in surprise.

"Well, you gotta have graduate students assistants for something," he responded. In the comment, not intended, Creed realized he had never had the luxury of a graduate assistant, and sighed. Some promising youngster, like Phoenix, that he could work with one-on-one.

"Something wrong?" Walter asked.

"I hate smart phones," Creed responded. He wanted to approach the project at hand, though an irritating computer generated female voice offering directions irritated him. Creed had only surmised that the older and more industrial parts of town would be near the river. The phone took him on a winding trek of streets he had no familiarity with. A few circles around the block and an occassional illegal U-turn were needed to get them to the old grubby bookstore.

The building itself seemed to have been built in the nineteenth century, as he could see a combination of dirty and open windows on the second and third floors. Rio de Oculto did not seem like a store that have enough books to fill three floors. There was no nob on the door inside, just a steel bar across the frame. Creed opened it and stepped inside.

A subtle musty smell entered his nostrils as he entered, and it was a welcome one. This was definitely a used book store, and the smell of the books in lesser repair reminded him of his small hometown library, where he read anything and everything, particularly if it seemed to discuss forbidden subject matter. This place seemed more like dustbin subject matter, but Creed couldn't help but pause at the mental wanderings that must have produced so many books.

"Can I help you sir?" asked a bored looking teenage girl with a pentacle around her neck.

"Yes, we understand a Robert Friedman was here recently."

"Oh," she said, her eyes widening. "I'm going to have to get the owner about that." 

Without anything more than that she ran up a spiral staircase two steps at a time into a dimly lit room on the second floor. A man in his late thirties, dressed all in black with an eagle talon hanging from a silver chain on his neck appeared. Unlike the girl, who had not come back down, he addressed his patrons upright and straightforwardly. "You're expected. But not without a ticket."

Walter pulled his card from his pocket and flashed the side with the word HADES his index and middle fingers.

"The film is downstairs. I am to give a customary warning."

"Warning?" Creed asked.

"Yes. Nothing escapes the land of the dead."
