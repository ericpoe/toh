Synopsis: Dr. Creed wavers on his decision to take a series of flights to Greece, only to find a poem, stuffed in his passenger's seat titled He Who The Angels Fear to Change. This poem revolves around an angelic chorus, and Satan's insistence not to stay bound to it. The poem itself deals with a topic: how does one love things that can change? In the case of the Angels it is Fear.

Reflecting on this topic indirectly leads to Creed gathering his courage to meet a hacker named Electra in the obscure Greek town of Kavala. They talk, and Electra tells a newspaper story of a cave discovery not subsequently printed anywhere else. They follow this lead and find a Theatre of Hades, leading them to the film, the Garden of Treason.

Dr. Creed watched from the long-term parking lot the airplanes taking flight from the Las Vegas International Airport. He and Ali had had considerable debate on the nature of that viscuous glop that had so changed the nature of West Point.

Upon returning to Margot, it became clear she had something she needed to say to a journalist, some sensitive topic that she would not discuss with Creed on the grounds that she wanted to tell as few people as possible. She wished to remain anonymous, and point an investigator to uncovering a tale of some kind. Ali was most happy to oblige her, and, so all should be equal, gave Margot's ticket to Creed.

There remained the question of exactly where the Theatre that would accept the ticket might be located. There was a little discussion, for it was agreed that if the ticket was to be in Creed's hand, he was inclined to search for the Theatre in Greece. From there, the conversation lay not in challenging that assumption, but considered where there might be a flicker of unreality to follow. Ali had many contacts and appointments, and it took some time to trace, in his notes, that he had received word of a strange shipment of computer parts. Records of the order had been hacked, and it had been determined the destination was a de-commissioned Russian military base.

This did not sit well with Creed. Up until now, the tickets he had been receiving and the theatres he had been finding were in positions of safety. Ali's ticket had not, and Margot's unexplained behavior suggested hers had not either. A university unaccepting of his absence, a long draining job search, these had been possibilities growing in Creed's mind and he was beginning to accept them. A flight to the political instability of Greece was an entirely different path than the one he had experienced.

As such, he paused. He looked back at the car, looking for an out. But as he stared at it, he instead noticed a paper sticking from his passenger seat. Margot may have dropped it, or possibly Phoenix. He opened the car door and reached for the note. If there were anything written on it, reading it might delay his decision.

It had been folded up, and the paper moistened by Margot's presence in the car. The ink, however, had not smudged.

#### He Who the Angels Fear to Change

> He did call forth, "You angels sing,"
"And of my glory forever ring."
And circles, choirs, throngs called his name.
In waves that pulsed but never changed.

> In most exquisite loops the chords did pour,
But always to pre-written score.
They brought Him courage, safety, might.
Until He conceived the son of light.

> "He shall make all others shrill
For I shall give him unfettered will.
And my greatest angel he shall be
Oh Lucifer now come to me!"

> The Angel did first hear the song,
Felt his Father could do no wrong.
But the chorus needed not his full ability
And from its trap he wanted free.

> He poured forth his soul in boundless art
With rebellion in his heart.
He wrote of time and space and more,
Not the bounty evermore.

> And God did examine his songs to be,
And called these things blasphemy.
"Lucifer, oh traitorous wretch.
Look at the horror you would sketch!"

> "Forever, shall I cast aside,
Such heresy as I can not abide.
Heaven is the place all know,
But for you there shall be Hell below."

> Startled did the Angel call his kin,
"You know the prison that is Hymn!
You know I wrote not to deprave,
But call up new worlds for the brave!"

> And God did say "If your desire your own.
Satan you should always be alone.
But hearing Satan's desperate words
God's chorus was lessened by a third.

> And in Hell did the pronouncement ring.
"I care not if you angels sing."
The war did end, and choice you sought,
Now your praises move me not.

> "But what," they cried," of those above?
With whom we sang, embraced, and loved?
"If thou wish to know that singing throng,
Your heart need only know their song.

> And knowest most for your own sake,
A choice did your other brethern make.
I cannot know, 'tis wondrous strange,
They loved the God they feared to change.

It struck him as a most unusual poem. The theology was novel. The long accepted row between God and Satan had been pride. This row had been over independence, which to God appeared as pride. But it was not the theology that he was primarily interested in.

Lucifer had sought more than the Chorus, more than the Hymn of the Consensus. Creed, too, would be leaving the consensus. Not that he hadn't taken considerable steps already, but he hadn't taken the step of no return. He had not been tossed from "Paradise" as it would have been called if he completed the Christian metaphor.

But there was something more in the poem than the struggle of good and evil. More than separation for the Everlasting One. There was this idea of love and change. It seemed to him abominable, that love should be succepted to no change. Was it not the fundamental experience of human life to change, to exist from one time to another? Was not the love of something which could not change somehow inhuman? Would not returning to a professorship, that sapped him of inspiration for being the same year-to-year, be of equal folly?

No, Ali had made him an appointment, in the provincial Greek town of Kavala, with a female computer hacker named Electra Samaras, and he attended on keeping it. He walked now with assured calm towards the airport. He knew what would happen next: the ticket exchanges, customs, security, waiting for a seat. There would be several connecting flights: New York, Lisbon, and Athens. Then, as he was firmly on the ground, a two hour bus ride east to Kavala.

It seemed a rather unlikely place to meet a hacker--he wondered to just what extent internet access would be available at all. He was, however, excited to be going to a part of Greece with which he was quite unfamiliar. He tried to imagine, as his plane took off, the reverse process that would happen eighteen hours later, in Athens. His memory was a bit too dim for the exercise, and instead he watched the clouds, and that blue band that seemed to separate earth from space at 30,000 feet.

Airports always held a dual feeling for Creed. The mass of people on journeys all in one place was inspiring, but the congregation of so many dirty and tired travelers was a bit revolting. He knew the airport in New York to some degree, as he had been there to record for some of those odious Atlantis shows, but Lisbon was a confounding place, as he sought his connecting flight without knowing Portugese. But, in his terminal, there were translations in Greek directing him to his plane.

The Athens airport was sparse and surprisingly unwelcoming. He was certain the town itself would feel like a second home, but the character of Athens streets seemed different after all that had transpired in Europe. He sensed an anger and wariness where crowds were gathered, and the bus ride to Kavala was wearisome and uncomfortable. His being on the ground, he figured, had allowed the jet lag to start wearing him down.

When at last he got to his feet, the pictersque town uplifted him from his exhaustion. Here was something he did not grow tired of seeing: a town laid out before the days of automobiles and steel, where the layout of downtown had been built from the beginning based on the properties of clay. Mopeds and pushcarts navigated the alleyways from a time when sidewalks were really the only thing worth lying out.

Best of all, there was a beach. The great Aegean Sea. So many tales had been told of its crossing, from the Odyssey to the accounts of the Battle of Salamis, when Athens hemmed in might Persia. Saltwater was abrasive and unfit for consumption, but being near it was a soft and simple pleasure long forgotten in Creed's days in Minnesota.

Ali had given Creed a number of printouts detailing the cafe where his contact would likely be waiting on him. They were, however, just paper, and a bit of meandering was required to make his way there. It took little time to pick out Electra, focused as she was tapping away at a laptop keyboard.

Her thick dark hair was most certainly of Greek origin, but she seemed a little pale, at least for someone who seemed to be waiting out in the sun, or at least the cafe shade. She was tall and lanky, but the curve her breast seemed to indicate she wasn't starving. She looked up, considered him, and went to typing away at her keyboard. It seemed he would have to interrupt.

"Electra," he coughed, and added no more out of self consciousness.

"You are Jonathon Creed?" she asked, in an awkward British English, as though she'd tried to learn the language from BBC broadcasts."

"Yes," he fired back in Greek, though he imagined just as awkwardly, given how long it had been since he'd spoken modern Greek.

"Sit," it appeared the conversation was to take place in Greek. "Ali speaks quite highly of you. You speak Russian?"

"Umm... no."

"Then you're are a computer expert?"

"No, again."

"I had noted some instructions regarding a strange shipment of computer parts. I was told you were to help. I do not quite grasp how you are to do that. What expertise do you have?"

"I'm a doctor of the classics."

"An American expert of Greek history. You must let me know what Ali was thinking."

"Those computer parts were to be sent to a decommissioned base, correct?"

"Yes. It shouldn't be there."

"It occur to you that the computer parts aren't there either?"

"You mean a dead end."

"In a manner of speaking... How do I say this? There is an unreal shipment to an unreal base, and I think it is happening."

"You're not making any sense."

"I didn't come here to talk sense. I came to resolve an issue. Ali picked me, out of his extensive list of contacts no doubt, because he suspected I knew the situation best."

"Ok then, what is the situation?"

"Have you ever had a goal? A desire? A passion? Have you wanted it a great deal, only to find all your actions are working against it?"

Electra, who had been sitting with her arms crossed in apparent irritation, let them go, and looked down. She fidgeted a great deal with a cafe napkin before answering, "Yes. However, I don't see how that follows my current purpose, which requires finding out more about the shipment."

"Have you ever seen once of these?" Creed flashed Margot's former ticket before her. She examined the English lettering, but looked a little befuddled. "HADES," Creed said, after he guessed that she might have difficulty with the proper noun.

"I thought these were just a rumor," she said at last.

"What rumors have you heard?" 

"Films of the dead. I hear they play films of the dead for the living. Why any entity should do such a thing, I have no guess."

"I've seen them. Three in fact. They show up unpredictably, the theatres the films are shown in, but they always seem located somewhere where two things aren't meshing. When a truck that shouldn't exist does and doesn't."

"Where some sort of break occurs?"

"Yes."

"Well then, I did remember seeing something strange in the papers the other day. A man had ventured into a cave, and discovered a rare and ancient musical instrument. I sought to clarify the manner, as it so happened to be a favorite cave of my daughter. I continued to seek clarification in travel brochures, only to find the paper turn up missing. I eagerly purchased a second copy, of which there was no mention at all." 

"Where is this cave?"

"It's about any hours ride from here, we should be able to make there by day, if we hurry. Might be back before my daughter falls asleep."

"Before I fall asleep," Creed yawned.

The pair took an urgent trot to the bus station, where they transferred a few times before arriving at the cave. Creed appreciated not having to argue and reason with Electra on this expedition, as he had with previous theatre-goers. However, he did not find himself able to stay awake to appreciate it. Almost as soon as the trip began, Electra bumped him and the entrance to the cave was right in front of them. Upon arriving they noted a sign that read "Closed to Visitors". A man waited patiently behind the scene, barring any easy entry. That was until Creed brandished a ticket and he stated, "This way please."

The cave where the Theatre is located is a throwback to the first draft where the Lute of Orpheus was discovered. Put it in because I might do something with it.
"Do you have a great desire and find your every action works against it?"
