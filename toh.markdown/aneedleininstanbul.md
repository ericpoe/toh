	There was a slight wrapping heard in William Creed's office. It was his nephew Jonathon, who had come from Minnesota for a viist.

"Jonny!" William said in delight, tossing down a few papers and grabbing his cane.

"Uncle."

"What brings on the visit? You don't write you don't call. Not an email or text. I'm even on facebook this days, much as I try to avoid it."

"It was a last minute decision, to be sure."

"Jonny you aren't on a run from the law now are you? There's only so much more adventure left in this old bones."

"Or trees to add to the clutter in your office." 

William looked about. "Well, the milkcrates are an improvement. Back in my day you couldn't see the floor. I've decided I'm important enough that some scholar will want to go through my paper and write a book about me. Why should I bother getting things in order for him?"

"You can clean when you're dead?" Jonathon asked.

"I suppose."

"Well, I have a question."

"One which merits a personal visit?"

"Yes. Your professional opinion."

"Oh?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.

"I've been working on a history project."

"Still the Atlantis stuff? I saw you on television."

"I really wish you hadn't."

"Why not? You did a great job, you know. Took on the role of stuffy professor that doesn't believe in fairy tales and wants real evidence with utmost earnestness."

"I didn't do it as a joke."

"I know you didn't. It's just a position a scholar finds themself in time after time. When someone wants to *believe* something, well, records and evidence are secondary."

"Yes, well, I ran into a snag. I had access to some documents. The very oldest."

"Oh?"

"I made a translation, but I lost the originals."

"Original singular, or originals plural?"

"Plural actually. One of them's more in my area of expertise. So, as you know, history isn't what happened. It's what's on record."

"Yes, I'm awere of the distinction." 

"So there comes a point when the remaining records are so scarce as to make it impossible to make a historical account of anyone's life. The figure in ancient Greek history worth making an historical account of, but which is impossible, is the Greek statesman Solon. The document mentions him, and events that happened before his time."

"And you've no physical evidence this document ever existed."

"That sums it up."

"You know, I'm only teaching one class this semester. I'm still teaching because I don't quite have it in my to retire. I've read a great deal of history papers, and in all that time, I've played the scholar that said *'bring forth the evidence'*. In many ways I regret that. It always seemed at least once a year I had a student with the most inventive thing I'd ever seen, but the evidence was lacking. I know I've spent my time trying to breed skepticism, but there were moments where I felt I might be looking at some new line of inquiry, and I shot it down. Maybe I was right. But if I have any regrets on the subject, those would be it. And there was one in particular..."

"I'd like to hear it."

"This was back in the 60's you see. There was a new book out, by Thomas Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientifc Revolutions*. Completely fascinating work, about revolutionary changes of thought and inquiry. Of course, a lot of people actually use the word revolution..."

"...but they don't really know what it means."

"You've heard this lecture?"

"I remember a few parts."

"Well, suffice it to say, that I often say revolutions sound sexy, but rarely do they actually happen. In any case I was young, fascinating, and reckless, looking for some new ground to cover in history."

"The fighting between relativity and quantum mechanics?"

"That came later. That's really where I could stake my name. Not enough historians with enough vigor to make their way through the math. Made tenure at the University of Chicago. But before that."

"Before?"

"I don't think I've really ever told this story to you, though perhaps you remember some Turkish or Arabic phrase I taught you? You must have been four or five at the time."

"I don't really remember that. Just you summer vacation house, by Lake Huron."

"Sold that house some time ago I'm afraid. Another of my few regrets. In any case, I took after that book, and started studying the history of science. I tried winding back the clock, to as far back as science would go. I'm sure you're quite aware the much of our knowledge of the classics comes from surviving Arabic translations. So that's where I went, with all my intellectual energy. 

"It was a dead end, and I found a niche that was more contemporary. A lot of my colleagues just couldn't stomach the math. Hell, even I tried learning a new language and studying abroad before I broached it myself."

"Where'd you study?"

"Istanbul. Istanbul. The Western tip of the Middle East. I was up, it was late at night. I was reading the journals of obscure fellow from Islamic history. His journal entry, it picked at the tenets of *revealed truth* a tradition common to Christians and Muslims, and spelled out what "could" be known / studied. The arguments were much the same as their counterparts in the scientific revolution, Bacon, Hobbes, etc. 

"I thought here was my revolutionary thinker. But it was late at night. I had this vague sense that I was doing some wrong. At least against the rules. I didn't want to say anything so I just kept reading. He kept mentioning some kind of *'festival of the damned'* for which he'd been given some kind of ticket. In that festival there seemed to be some kind of *'Theatre of Prophets'*. It might have been at that festival where he'd first stumbled on these ideas. 

"I was writing down some bibliographic notes on my bookmark, because I didn't want to get up to get some paper. I fell asleep in the room. The book had been replaced, and I only felt a sense of uneasiness when I inquired about it with the university where I was studying. But I know the book must have existed because my notes were still there. And there was what appeared to be some sort of invitation, very cryptic."

"What did it say?"

"You will see life and death where two great rivers meet." 

"That's all?" 

"That's all. It's funny, I've never been able to forget it. Or the feeling I had around it. Like you're going to puncture reality. But then reality feels your pin prick and heals and you never see where the pin went. Swallows it up like death and never gives it back." 

"So what did you do after that?"

"Made a name for myself in some completely unrelated time period."

"But you think they're related."

"Separated by six centuries. If related not by time. Related by occuppying the same place in my memory, I suppose, but that will pass when I do."

"When you pass. But you've still some time to solve the riddle?"

"Well yes. But I gave up on it a long time ago. Big rivers meet all the time. They're called tributaries. I've looked over my notes a thousand times for some geographical hint as to which rivers it might be, and I'm not about to jaunt about the Middle East looking for some damn fool experience I had fifty years ago."

"Given up on the topic?"

"In a way? I'm not sure. I feel there is a answer. I just felt it wasn't something I would be able to do. I'd love to solve it, or it wouldn't have stayed in my mind all this time. What rivers would the gentleman be referring to."

"Well, suppose there isn't a gentleman."

"Hmm?"

"Hard for a historian, but forget the source. If someone just showed you a map of your location, and told you to find two big rivers, where would you go?"

"St. Louis, I suppose. Missouri and Mississippi meet. Or maybe a bit further south. Cairo, where the Ohio and Mississippi meet."

"A trip to St. Louis?"

"On that flimsy reasoning?"

"You still have that invitation?"

"Yes?"

"And you can find it in *this* office?"

"Yes... I see your point."

"Well then, you coming?"

"I've got a few loose ends to tie up."

"I don't have forever."

"Ok, one of two."
