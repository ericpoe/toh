### The Culinary Black Arts

- Notes
- A story about unrestrained growth
- Suddenly for no reason, it rains a black goop all over the desert of West Point, Nevada. It's considered a nuisance until an outsider eats some an reports it's delicious
- The goop is a culinary delight that brings great wealth, turning West Point into a boom town. It seems everyone wants a piece of the pie.
- Restaurants, agribusiness, the military, real estate, drugs, prostitution, the mob, higher education and science descend like a source of nature on this traditional town. (The military not in the original draft.

### New Story

I'm on a new draft where the story helps along the major plot line, in addition to working for it's own sake. In this version there will be real people. Last version was more like an essay with description. I'm planning on a journalist interviewing:

1. A traditionalist
2. A military man
3. A real estate developer.

All these characters genuinely care about their surrounding and have a point of view. The traditionalist sees the changes as inevitable but wants old town values (democracy and participation) to remain. The military man grows tired of the private contractors and politicians sucking the government coffers dry through corruption in the military. He doesn't see the military presence to be any form of protection. The real estate developer has mob contacts and understands its interest in the town without supporting it, along with not being too happy about other speculators. 

### The Hidden Story

The four interviews conclude with the story of those three characters banding together to stop a plot by the US military to engage in weapons research by putting engineered microorganisms in the black goop to see where it pops up. When no illness pops up, and the truck covertly carrying their corrupted goods disappears, they suspect a plot. However, no matter how hard they try, they can't pin it on anything but a random robbery. The journalist uncovers this story, but makes a point to hide it away, for later revealing. 

### The Real Estate Developer

"I'm a real estate speculator--first one to show up in West Point. The root of all evil, according to some."

"To the old timers."

"To them certainly, but I'm more like them than they reckon."

"How so?"

"I'm not giving up on this town. The construction contractors, my fellow speculators, the industry--hell from a lot I've heard the military--are all going to give up when that Black Rain doesn't come a second time.

"There'll only be three groups to hang on. The old timers, the church, and the mob."

"are they here now?"

"The mob? They always show up in a real estate bubble."

"You seem quite certain."

"Listen son, people thought I was crazy when I said the mob was infiltrating the garbage companies. Who takes your trash out now? The mob goes anywhere it thinks the law won't find it. Like when the law sees too much profit in a land bubble to care about the mob getting a cut. It's just business."

"Were you certain the Black Rain wouldn't come again when you came here?"

"No, I didn't It's a funny story, what changed my mind."

### The military / scientific officer

Amongst my stories at West Point, there is one that remains the most troublesome, not necessarily for its content but certainly for who is involved--the military. It should surprise few people that the military should show an interest in a strange and unexplained food source. An army marches on its stomach after all. But some fuss always arises from actual physical evidence. Something that makes vague worries about the government fact. So here lies the account.

It occurred to me that in the hasty constructions around West Point, for about a period of two and a half months there was only one public internet service provider in West Point. It would be expected that anyone offering covert services would take protective measures regarding access to the internet. However, should I get a record of the entire period these precautions could easily have not been enough to cover the government's tracks.

Here I provide enough detail on how I obtained the data to verity my claims in this piece as legitimate.

My researches led me to believe that the best way to hack their ISP would be to gain physical access to the machine. A great deal of security is (and should be) directed towards the internet. security on the physical machine is minimal by comparison.

My researches also led me to conclude that the one barrier safeguarding the machine was an administrative password.

The security of a password, never really changed with the advent of computers. Outsiders must not learn the password and insiders must remember the password. Computer password should change frequently , be random, and not be written down. 
\
Owing to me lack of precise technical knowledge, it seemed my best hope that the administrator had violated the best practice of not writing the password down.

If it were written down, it was also likely to be quite close to the computer for easy access., and not difficult for the administer to find and refer to. Sure enough, it was there, and discovered with a determined search.

Upon gaining restricted access, I had a list of files and folders that should be sufficient information for a hacker to gain access remotely. Given tips from an anonymous hacker, I succeeded in locating a file named /etc/shadow. This is usually the location of the system's encrypted passwords written in plain text. A hacker in possession of such a file has beaten security.

I could have collected more information, but as my on-site access to the computer was limited I left quickly with the contents of that file. From there an attack on the ISP was possible. though I don't personally know the depth of the attack. Potentially every record was available: it is unreasonable to assume that for two and a half months the entire organization used encrypted connections / internet services for every single piece of communication and this turns out not to be the case.

I came across a great deal of information whilst an anonymous group of hackers helped me sift through the digital details in a story with real information. Not just a random collection of facts but enough mutually supporting evidence to develop a full story.

Any journalist, when faced with sensitive evidence, must make a determination of what is truly best to reveal. Should one release evidence or tell a story? If a story, who's story should be told?

In my case I would like to reveal the military in its own words. How did they talk to each other during the event? It seemed to me a story that should be told and that unlike other stories, it had not been adequately treated by someone else.

### The traditionalist

"Back in my day, when something affected the town, there was a meeting. No one told you what to do on your land. But when you did something that affected all the town, you brought it up in the meeting. People didn't always agree. Sometimes they event went against the agreements reached in those meetings. But everyone knew where you stood and where the town stood, and that if you went against the consensus your voice diminished."

Now West Point town halls, there was a cast of disagreeable characters that made it hard to get things done. But things that affect everybody should be talked about by everybody.

People will say you can't get things done that way in the town and that's the problem. I know we can't go back to the times before the Black Rain. But we're getting rid of the one thing that mattered.

"Noways the real estate people do real estate, the school board does education, the big city food merchants talk to the state government on distribution Nobody talks to the..."

"Stakeholders."

"Stock holders?"

"Well in business there are stock holders and stakeholders. The stakeholders are everyone that have a stake in the company's decision. Stock holders are the ones that stand to gain or lose money by a company's profits."

"Outsiders or insiders right? It's only the insiders they listen to any more. And isn't it convenient that all the old timers are outsiders, irrelevant, couldn't possibly know what's good for the new town?"

"All started with the damn mayor bamboozling us and making us follow the rules and not their spirit. A few months after the rains had come a scheme from everyone. a lot of people would have supported this or that, but no one wanted a meeting.

"So some folks went after the mayor. There was a rule made about 15 years ago, I remembered it as I voted on it. You couldn't end a meeting without a majority vote to have it ended.

"So the mayor comes with this contract. No one likes it, so after the discussion we all vote not to sign the contract and go home.

"But the contract is fake. The terms were made to look poor. Because there's a real contract, with it's share of subtle legal traps he wants to pass. He waits for everyone to leave, without voting to end the meeting. Then he signs the contract he wants to pass when no one's there.

"Now no one believes the action legitimate, but because it isn't written down you need a minimum person, and it's a legal contract enforced by the state it proved too hard to put a stop to it, even though most people wanted to.

"Our people saw you could get things done this way, everyone decided to do things thins way, and the process suffered as a result."
