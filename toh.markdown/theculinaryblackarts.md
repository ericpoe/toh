### The Culinary Black Arts

- Notes
- A story about unrestrained growth
- Suddenly for no reason, it rains a black goop all over the desert of West Point, Nevada. It's considered a nuissance until an outsider eats some an reports it's delicious
- The goop is a culinary delight that brings great wealth, turning West Point into a boom town. It seems everyone wants a piece of the pie.
- Restaurants, agribusiness, the military, real estate, drugs, prostitution, the mob, higher education and science descend like a source of nature on this traditional town. (The military not in the original draft.

### New Story

I'm on a new draft where the story helps along the major plot line, in addition to working for it's own sake. In this version there will be real people. Last version was more like an essay with description. I'm planning on a journalist interviewing:

1. A traditionalist
2. A military man
3. A real estate developer.

All these characters genuinely care about their surrounding and have a point of view. The traditionalist sees the changes as inevitable but wants old town values (democracy and participation) to remain. The military man grows tired of the private contractors and politicians sucking the government coffers dry through corruption in the military. He doesn't see the military presence to be any form of protection. The real estate developer has mob contacts and understands its interest in the town without supporting it, along with not being too happy about other speculators. 

### The Hidden Story

The four interviews conclude with the story of those three characters banding together to stop a plot by the US military to engage in weapons research by putting engineered microorganisms in the black goop to see where it pops up. When no illness pops up, and the truck covertly carrying their corrupted goods disappears, they suspect a plot. However, no matter how hard they try, they can't pin it on anything but a random robbery. The journalist uncovers this story, but makes a point to hide it away, for later revealing.
