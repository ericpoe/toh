### Description of finding the poem:
- Dr. Creed checked his pockets for his plane tickets, not there
- Scours the car
- Whilst her cowered before whether or not to make this reckless decision, it maddened him more to know the decision might be made for him on the basis either of an accident or the willfull intentions of HADES, who had made life changing documents disappear before him with no indication they would not do it again. 
- But if that were his position, he had arrived at the airport 4 and a half hours early, and he would search his belongings until his plane had left. 
- Digging amongst the cars pockets he discovered a thick, most piece of folded paper under the passenger side seat. It had to have gotten drenched from Mouse's entrance into the car. But the paper was quite sturdy, it seemed like it would be for writing something important, something Mouse would have noticed it's absence. 
- He unfolded the paper, the ink, also thick, had managed to survive its poor conditions and the bottom right corner contained a brief mark, a blur of squiggles and sharp angles that must have been a signature, and with some straining of the eye seemed to be "Phoenix". That precocious, wayward teenager had apparently dropped it in the car. 
- Given the events of the past few weeks he hadn't the ability to determine if she were even real, and the chances of seeing her again were remote at best.
- Even given the predicament of losing his tickets, he couldn't resist the impulse to read it. 

- Note: the poem referred to in this text is my classic, He Who the Angels Fear to Change.

The poem hit his mind with all the force a physical punch would. He had taught classic literature for some time. In this line of work, a particularly rewarding thing happened. He would assign a text at the beginning of class, a student would initially hate it, but then begin to realize the work's depth before the end of the semester it would become their favorite work. So much of literature, it seemed, revolved around having the patience to work with a text that was difficult to read. But sometimes the brilliance of a literary piece would be immediately obvious and it's ideas so firmly in line with your own history that it would change how you looked at things forever. 

A very old Christian tradition held that the first of the angels fell. Lucifer, God's brightest star had the pride to believe he could rule in God's stead. He brought forth a third of the angels to start a war in heaven, which he lost, and was cast down forever into hell, forever cut off from God, and in constant opposition to his plan. It was a beautiful story, packed with love, betrayal, and terrible conflict. It also offered a clear explanation for the corruption of the world: pride. 

the replacement of that motive with a different one, a desire for independence, changed the story significantly. He had been raised a Christian, and was familiar with its stories and commandments. One of things that he had never been at ease with was the inconsitency with which Satan was depicted. The prince of lies, waiting to lead good Chrisitians away to the world of sin. He was infinitely crafting, full of cunning plans to make life difficult, exquisitely sensitive to human motives and ready to exploit them at any moment. 

Yet he despite being so tuned in to human motivations and all their complexities, he had only one motivation, hatred of God, on which he operated on at all times. How was it possible for a being driven only by maliciousness seemed to have so much empathy? It had seemed, as he pondered the religion he had given up. Shouldn't a religion that views the world through the lens of good and evil have a much richer understanding of their great adversary?

**Draft Material**
This was one of those poems. As an academic, he had heard many criticisms of the Christian religion before. This was something entirely different. It became clear to him that so many of the Bible's iconic stories had to do with extolling living up to your duty.Duty in your actions by following God's commandment, duty in your thoughts by maintaining your faith, and duty in your heart through reverence and worship. 

Have a positive outlook on duty, and these things brought you purpose, honor, glory, community with fellow believers, and a special place in eternal bliss after you die. The nature of the religion changed entirely when you substituted duty for obedience. Obedience to a set of abitrary rules, an unquestioning faith of ideas derived by others, and therefore a God you could never hope to feel any 

He began to see that he had replaced his faith for another, the academic field of history. It had never struck him that he kept persinstely asking questions that history couldn't solve, and it was this above all else that he could get published but he was a regular on television programs about myths. 

- After reading the poem, he continued in his pursuit of his missing tickets. He determined this might involve tearing the car up, so he put it in the back pocket of his driver's seat, the place he had designated for things it was too important to lose. Curiously enough, that was precisely where he put his plane tickets, because he wanted to make sure the his tickets and passport where in the same place. 
- His passport is almost out of date, by less than a few months. Might make the date significant, might not.
