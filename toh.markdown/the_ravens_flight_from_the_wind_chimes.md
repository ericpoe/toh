They arrive in a room with a Unix terminal and a great deal of information before attempting to escape through the ventilation shaft. Upon termination of the shaft, the discover the computer parts mentioned in Electra's hacks and the Theatre of Hades. It is revealed that the head programmer of the base was in fact Electra's father. Upon reaching the Theatre he gets the chapter's previous riddle "He'll come out the same way he came in refers to his dress."
-->

Creed heard of scuffling of footsteps and the an imploring child voice. He sought to wrench the door to his room open only to discover it was now unlocked. It flashed in him he couldn't disarm the guards outside his door, only to discover that there were no guards. 

He peered to the right, and saw Cora chasing down the corridor after something he could not see. He did, however, spot a bandage on her left arm and his mind went straight to the Blood of Apollo. She was having a vision of some kind, and a wild hope slashed into his imagination that it was a vision of escape. He ran after her, not bothering to say a word lest she be distracted. 

She paused in front of a door for a brief moment. Electra's interrogation room, he knew it. He thrust his way into the door and hammered it open. It did not give way and he jammed his shoulder. He recoiled in pain, resolved to strike the door again, only to hear a hideous snap, the jingle of keys, and a door wrenched open. It was indeed Electra. In the angular light that splattered across the hallways he could see the glint of a hundred metal tools, some angular, some blunt.

"We have to catch up with Cora, she knows the way out," Creed alerted Electra.

"What?" Electra exclaimed in surprise.

"She knows the way out," Creed hovered over her, and grabbed her by the wrist, flinging her out into the corridor. In the distance she could she a child running, and she could make out, "Come back Mr. Bird, come back!"

After a split second stare of recognition in each others eyes, Creed and Electra chased after Cora, who was heading straight for marching figures. 

They both sprinted towards her in a flight of death, their heels light as if buoyed by wings of flight on their ankles. Dumbstruck, they watched as every soldier on patrol was mysteriously distracted, moving to patrol somewhere else, or called to some meeting of great importance. 

Cora ran straight into a room with an electronic lock that was apparently broken, and Creed and Electra followed. A soldier with electrical tape in his hands lay motionless on the floor, electrocuted in what looked like maintenance of the circuit that kept the door shut.

Creed, gasping and wheezing, shut the door behind him, hoping the electric lock would look sealed from the outside. When he was not doubled over and gasping, he looked up to see Electra with her arms crossed around her black swimsuit. 

"This doesn't look like the way out," she said testily. "The only way back is out that hallway."

Creed's disappointment did not sink in however. He looked over at Cora, still addressing a phantom. "Mommy can find a way out from here?" Cora asked.

Electra turned on a dime, "I'm not..."

"The bandage, on her left arm."

Again she turned, to face Creed this time. "She's been interrogated..." It did not seem it should have quite surprised as it did, but Creed guessed Mom was clinging to the hope her captors might be uneasy interrogating a child. The illusion was gone, but so too was its usefulness. Cora was back in her presence. 

"Look around the room," Creed suggested. "Some supplies, something to keep going."

With an uneasy grace Electra examined the corpse in the room, removing two smoke grenades, a large pistol, an AK-47, a lighter, and a packet of cigarettes. 

Creed looked over and unbuttoned his jacket, placing it on Cora, who was shivering. 

"I don't believe it," Electra whispered, "A console."

"A what?" Creed asked.

"A terminal. Me might have some limited access to the computer system. Password protected. Of course. God damnit! A password in Russian no doubt."

"You're a hacker, aren't you?" Creed reminded.

"You can't hack a console if you can't log in," Electra shot back.

"Oh look. Playing cards!" Cora exclaimed with a naive joy. They'd been in the soldier's pocket. Creed took them out of their case and found a folded piece of paper. He walked over to Electra and unfolded it. 

"You were saying?" Creed asked.

"Don't get to cocky. This is an old military facility. Who knows what wonky, antiquated, classified system they're running?" Electra typed into the console. "Login in successful. Huh," Electra paused, see didn't speak for several seconds, as if a blunt object stunned her vocal chords. "Unix."

"You know it then?"

"Know it?" she had a sadism of some unknown source glinted in her eye. "I grew up with it. You're on babysitting duty while I get us out of this," she informed.

Creed sighed. Playing cards with a child locked in a covert military facility was not quite what he had in mind when he left teaching to find HADES. But making things up as he went along was starting to feel like the default mode his existence.

"Try go fish," Electra chuckled then turning back to the screen quickly snorted,"Damnit. Is this Unix from the 1970's. Yell at the computer, Creed thought. That worked some times.

Creed discovered go fish was not the proper card game to play against a child recovering from the effects of prophet blood. 

"That shot in your harm? Did it hurt?" Creed asked.

"A little," she said modestly.

"You sound like you took it like a big girl."

"I was a big girl," she said proudly. Creed had wanted details about her interrogation without her having to relive the nightmare. It seemed stroking her ego might get her to blurt out the whole affair.

"How?" He asked.

"Those mean soldiers questioned me for hours. They wanted to know about you and mommy. Why you came here a few days ago. What you did as a job, and mommy too. I kept telling them we were just out for a swim. I told them we didn't know anything about those jellies. They didn't believe me. They asked me so many times I thought they wanted me to lie."

"Did they?"

"Well I tried it," Cora replied, "and they could tell I was lying. They wouldn't let me eat or sleep. Then this crusty ugly lady came with that shot. Then I had a dream."

"What did you dream?" Creed asked.

"It was a scary dream." Cora shivered.

"A nightmare?"

"I don't think so. There was this bird, and these wind chimes. Millions of wind chimes, all rocking back and forth the same way. And they were angry wind chimes." Cora added with confidence.

"What were they mad about?" 

"Well, I don't know. They were mad, but, scared at the same time. The bird... he could soar with the wind, go anywhere he wanted. But these wind chimes could only move back and forth. They couldn't even go sideways. They said the most awful things about the bird. But the bird didn't say awful things about them. He just talked about how wonderful flight was, if only they could try it. But he couldn't show them. He'd been tied down. 

"Then some giant came down and said I had to choose. The wind chimes were so angry, and the bird was so helpless. I didn't know how the chimes tied him up. Maybe they'd tie me up. I didn't know much about the bird and he seemed really nice. I wanted the giant to choose, but he wouldn't. I was going to have to be a big girl and decide for myself. 

"But I didn't know how. I was nervous and needed to go to the bathroom. I thought I could decide if I just had a moment to decide. I said I wouldn't do anything without it. "

Creed trailed off for a moment. It seemed possible he could work out what had happened. The blood had given her some cryptic decision, as he himself had been given. An interrogator which listening to her statements, hoping some information about himself or Electra would come out. However, some time into the vision she must have suddenly demanded to go to the bathroom. He imagined the interrogator going out for some latrine bucket, leaving the door unlocked behind him, unaware Cora was still in her vision. He may have lacked experience giving someone a child-sized dose. Cora had obviously sided with the bird. 

"And so I helped the bird escape and he lead us here," Cora finished.

Creed looked over at Electra. He was certain she hadn't heard a word, though their was a trickle of blood around her lips. Some nervous tick had drawn blood.

"Damnit!" she exclaimed, "I can't do anything important without root access! Creed, check the damn soldiers pockets again. 

He went through the soldier's pockets. He noticed Cora still shivering again. It started his own restless shiver. They hadn't let her change. Wearing her down by cold, by sleep deprivation, by psychological coercion, all the techniques other than implements of physical torture. Dangerous people wanted them all dead. He redoubled his efforts, then shifted to the soldier's pants as well. Nothing.

Electra slid down in the chair in front of the computer. "This computer's so old I could write an exploit to hammer it to pieces, but not in the time we probably have left."

"You don't know that until we're actually discovered," Creed noted.

"No. Hacking requires tools. You can't just twiddle around a secure system. It has to have some error or flaw. It's possible if I had an internet connection..."

"There is no internet connection," Creed informed.

"You can't break into a locked house with your bare hands," Electra shot back.

"Hmm... but don't owners sometimes leave a key in the area surrounding the house?" Creed asked.

"Of course, if you work on the consideration that the system's already been hacked..." Electra went hammering away at the keyboard with renewed vigour. Within minutes she was pounding a panel next to the wall. Creed thought she was furious.

"My dad told me about this exploit. Just... and a root shell. Admin access! The damn system had already been hacked!"

"What?"

"Some engineer breaking into the system to give himself a raise, who knows? Let's see if there's any information on maintenance."

"Maintenance?"

"Dad always said that if you think you can't get out always go to maintenance. Ok, schematics. It will all be in Russian, of course, but I think I can get through the technical language. Electra went back to tapping at the keyboard. There was, Creed thought, something about her background he didn't want to know about. She could handle a gun, speak Greek, English, Russian and God only knew what else. As tender as her eyes had been, she had a military background.

Creed was broken from his reverie when he noticed Cora's eyes had changed somewhat. Her pupils had constricted, she had a distant expression that stared unblinkingly at something. Creed turned his head and noticed the soldier's dead body.

All prophetical thinking gone, she turned to Creed and said, "What's wrong with him?"

"He's..." he wanted to say asleep. But faced with lying to her or keeping her calm, he said "dead. I think he was working on an electrical circuit."

He expected her to cry, but she just stared at the body, and poked it.

"He won't move." Creed pulled her back. "It's terrifying, I know. That's why you need courage right now. Bravery. Strength. It's all in here," Creed pulled her hand over her heart. "And don't worry about a thing. We'll protect you."

"Ah ha!" Electra declared, listening to the screeching of a junk printer churning out pages. "Well that damn bird was right. If there's any hope of escaping, it'll be through this room. Check the soldier again to see if he has any tools."

Having died trying to fix an electrical socket, the soldier did indeed have tools. He wasn't really equipped for duct work, but the his screwdriver set and duct tape both looked useful.

"The air vent is across the hall. Let's get ready," Electra instructed.

Creed counted himself lucky that the upcoming seconds in the open were not going to get him any points for style. Electra had holstered the soldier's gun by having Creed thrust it down the back of her swimsuit, where he wondered if the weight of the damn thing might make it slip out or slip down, he couldn't decide. 

The absconded soldiers oversized pants which were held up only by his tool belt. Screwdrivers, wrenches, wirestrippers, a junk pile of wires, nuts, bolts, and duct tape were shoved in it. The AK-47 was strapped around Creed's back. The remaining items were stuffed in the shirt Cora was wearing: the playing cards, two smoke grenades, and a pack of cigarettes. Creed didn't think they'd be able to make much of a quick getaway in this outfit, but Electra's determined eyes soothed him. 

Creed imagined there would never be a right moment for in which a soldier was not looking. At least he imagined never being able to find it without more Blood of Apollo. But the hallway was so dead he could hear his heartbeat better than boots clocking on the floor.

They ran across the hallway about as gracefully as a child whose stolen a cookie in the middle of the night. The room they entered did have a ventilation shaft with an human sized vent about six feet off the ground. Electra flicked through Creed's tool belt for a screwdriver, flicked her lighter, and said "Hoist me up."

Creed knelt to the ground and cupped both hands together. Electra stepped into it with one foot and hoisted her other leg against the wall. The room danced with shadows from the lighter near the air vent. They flickered on Electra's bare leg. It was tapered and smooth. Just like the rest of her body, it was supple.

He had noticed this of course, the moment they met, and of course when they were at the beach, but his mind had been elsewhere. Lost, broke, and soon to be pursued by an unknown Russian regiment, he hadn't had time to let it sink in. He hadn't time to fantasize. Now her legs with there, the muscles pulled tight by her struggle to reach the air vent and unscrew it. 

He thought back a moment again about Alice. He was certain, still, that he'd never had a chance. He was too young. He lacked any swagger. He didn't have the slightest idea how to approach a woman. And if by some miracle they had gotten together, he'd still be in his home town...

A screw dropped and hit him in the cheek. He flinched and Electra wobbled. The leg Electra balanced against the wall kicked outward and hit him in the left shoulder. Which slackened the cup on her bottom foot. Creed swiveled his body to were the bottom foot looked like where it was going to go, Electra retracted other leg back against the wall maintained her balance.

"Pay attention!" she slightly hissed.

"Screw in the face," Creed protested.

"Oh. Well keep an eye out for the next one."

Yes, he'd been in his hometown, not in a military base trying to escape through an air duct. But he wouldn't be alone and... oh hell, there wasn't much chance Alice would have understood him anyway. Likely he'd been trying to ignore a dull and insipid job by long stretches of time in the library, neglecting Alice and wondering how things would have been if only he'd went to college. 

No, no, he had a beautiful woman right in front of him, and there just might be a chance they'd find some supply closet to make love in right before they were shot. A second screw brushed his shoulder in way to the floor and tinkled as it hit the floor. Electra pushed the panel she was working on aside.

"Now all the way," Electra told him, and he struggled to get to his feet as she disappeared into the vent. 

Creed looked at the vent. "Uh, a little help?" He asked Electra.

"I can't turn around," Electra stated.

"I'll need the lighter to see what I'm doing," said Creed.

"Oh crap. I should have lit a cigarette. Here, to the left," she slid the lighter down.

Creed but reached his hands up. 

"Yes, that's my leg, now to the left," Electra responded irritably.

Creed fumbled a bit more for the lighter, retrieved a cigarette from Cora and lit it, passing the lighter back to Electra. He placed his make shift torch on the other side of the vent. He was convinced trying to pull himself up would be a disaster, that he didn't have the strength.

"Get in the vent before you get shot." Electra scolded.

He had forgotten he was working on a deadline and the result of not making it. His heart jolted, then the rest of him followed, straight up the wall and into the vent. Once in there in the vent he better understood Electra's position. He couldn't turn around either. How to get Cora up?

"How's Cora supposed to get up here?" he asked.

"Oh damnit. The soldier, did he have any rope on him?" Electra asked.

Creed scrounged his tool belt, "Just wiring." 

"Fuck. We're on a survival mission without rope. Ok, the gun."

"Which gun?" Creed asked.

"The gun strapped around your back. You still have it don't you? Umm... it's got a strap right?" Electra said in expectation.

Creed unbuckled a strap from his gun, pulling in left shoulder unsticking it in the squashed space. He grabbed ahold of it, crawled backward, and let it dangle out of the belt.

"Cora, grab on," Creed instructed.

When he felt a pull against the strap. He tried to pull the thing tightly to his chest but his he did so felt Cora trying to climb the makeshift rope at the same time. He couldn't grasp it quite well, and could hear Cora bouncing off something. A small hand grabbed onto his foot and drew his leg back. To balance himself he grabbed Electra's ankle, and she fell flat on her face. But she also grabbed onto something further ahead that stopped Creed from being dragged, and eventually a second hand grabbed his other foot. Cora was pulled up, her pack of cigarettes slid towards Electra for lighting. Cutting some duct tape with the wire strippers and attaching it to the vent panel, it was taped back into position, before the three moved forward.

As the three began crawling wherever Electra had in mind, a blast of warm air came through vents. 

"Oh thank God," Electra whispered, and fiddled around until she had a lit cigarette by which to navigate. In the dim light it became apparent that he'd graduated from getting a chance to admire her legs unsuspected. He now got a direct view of her bent over in front of him. He was cramped, hungry, and needed to urinate, but things weren't all bad, considering.

They spent what seemed fifty to a hundred feet, back tracking towards their own rooms. He could hear the bustling of soldiers, perhaps fanning out to search for them. He heard shouting and doors being opened and slammed. It was terrifying, but they continued onward. The soldiers were looking for them, not listening. 

The Electra stopped. The vent went straight over a room in which people were talking adamantly, but also softly.

"Where's Creed?" a man demanded, his fist pounding a desk.

"I don't know. Our people left them in their rooms," came an otherworldly female voice, presumably behind the desk.

"You did nothing to alert us," the man complained.

"My interrogators finished in the time that was alloted to them. Both Creed and Samaras were interrogated according to procedure."

"What about the girl?"

"If Creed escaped, as you suggest, he must have been able to rescue her," the voice gave an impression of clicking.

"How? That's impossible," the soldier insisted.

"Impossible things happen with some frequency, haven't you noticed? Especially these days."

"What? Impossible things don't happen at all! That's why they're impossible. Your people assisted them out," the soldier accused.

"Really? Then why don't you check the surveillance footage?" the other voice retorted.

"They aren't on it. Every interrogator left their room on or ahead of schedule."
he sighed. "Did they, find anything?"

"You know I can't tell you," the woman laughed, "but their capture was most opportune. Ties up a few loose ends. Why did you pick them up? Did your contact tell you?" 

"It was classified," The soldier responded.

The woman laughed. It was a musical laughter, a sing song beautiful thing, except some of the notes didn't feel human. "Classified? That contact's agency is ludicrous."

"What do you know about them?"

"His agency's mission," the woman began again, "as I understand it, is to find all the world's secrets and store them on a computer. A computer network anyway. A rather crude approach, though interesting in its audacity.'

"Crude? Crude how?" the soldier asked.

"Such a system like that is only as safe as the system of control surrounding the people who have access. And here you are, unable to uncover you subject's secrets because you don't know what questions to ask, because you don't have access."

"Access can be granted at a later time," noted the soldier.

"In time to recover from your subject's impossible escape? I think not. But I see a determination not to leave my desk without something tangible. So I must ask, how much is it worth it to you, to see this man captured? Or the woman? Or the girl?"

"I can get the money," the soldier reassured.

"Money? Oh dear. Oh dear." the woman sounded like mother disappointed in her child's repeated failure. "That's not really worth much to you is it? It's not really worth much to anyone. It changes hands just as soon as there's something more worthwhile to be purchased. No, I need for you to betray a secret."

"What?" the soldier was shocked.

"A secret. Perhaps some sexual transgression you'd prefer no one know? A best friend's wife cheated on? Ever snuck it in while a woman was passed out?"

"No."

"So I'm dealing with an honorable man?" The woman gave a haughty laugh. "Not one whose sold out his employer's classified information to save himself, or has computer access he shouldn't?"

"No."

"Or maybe your dick is two inches. Maybe your testicles never descended from your abodomen? Would you tell me about that?"

"Enough. Save for the classified information, how would that do you any good?"

"Waiting to see what leverage I have before divulging a secret, are you? Or maybe just taking a more adversarial stance after I insulted your manhood?" The woman speculated.

"Alright bitch, what do you want?"

"Bitch? Don't like dealing with a female superior officer? Or maybe I just have something you want, and I won't give it to you, is that it? You haven't walked out," she chided.

"No."

"Because I have a secret. Many, in fact. Creed's getting out of this place the same way he came in."

"That's impossible," the soldier reasserted.

"Not for him," the woman corrected.

"Who is he? Intel says he was just a adjunct professor at a State University."

"Creed's just a man in extraordinary circumstances. He doesn't have a special background. He's not tough, not a good shot, not a computer genius, not a police detective with brilliant powers of deduction. But he had something not apparent that made him interesting to my employer."

"What?" The soldier looked baffled.

"Humans have been telling stories since before they discovered fire. And they are all sent to death, these stories, after they reach the last pair of ears that will retell the tale."

"What does this have to do with anything?"

"Let me continue," said the woman. "Creed spent his academic career, when he wasn't teaching, trying to revive dead stories. There was a story of particular obsession for him, one he thought he could revive, or perhaps wasn't really dead. But he discovered other stories. Stories from the land of the dead."

"So?"

"Your employer has kept you completely in the dark then. This situation must have been worth keeping secret. I regret to inform you that nothing more I say will make any sense."

"What about Creed?" The soldier demanded.

"He'll come out the same way he came in. If he's so important to the higher ups
capture him before that happens."

"What about Electra? Or the girl?" The soldier continued.

"Did he come in with them?" The woman asked.

"Yes."

"Then there's you answer," she replied. "Now, if you don't mind, I'll be going out to the cafe outside town."

"The base is on lock down," The soldier state.

"Details, details. Now out of my office." She gracefully shut the door, allowing Electra, Creed, and Cora to continue. They seemed to be moving over a place no one was guarding, for they couldn't hear anything. After thirty minutes they discovered a central shaft that branched out in many directions. Electra wiggled her way out of the duct with Creed holding onto her feet. Electra turned and kept him steady at his shoulders while he slid down the wall perpendicular to the duct. Then she held her hands out for her daughter, who scooted out without much trouble.

"Well, we've reached our starting point, but where to go if this place is on lock down?" Electra asked.

"Umm... out the way we came?" Creed suggested.

"That's ridiculous. I don't know about you, but I didn't see a thing," Electra retorted.

"That woman, If she was a woman, was certain we'd retrace our steps somehow. But she was being quite cryptic about the whole thing. I wonder if it wasn't a riddle."

"No time for riddles. Solutions." Electra emphasized.

"Mommy, I'm hungry." Cora said.

"Well, Electra, you've got the map."

"The problem is that it's a base map. The guards are on alert. Since we're in the air ducts there are a lot of places we could get out of. But it doesn't do us any good if we're still on the base."

"Maybe could get out through a supply depot of some kind?" Creed suggested.

"There is a large storage facility... here." Electra pointed in the dim light. "It's placement is rather peculiar. I'm going to cross-reference the ventilation with the electrical grid." 

"Your play Electra," said Creed.

"That's funny. The storage facility is right off the main ventilation tunnel. The room is exceptionally well ventilated, but... without any electrical outlets. It's really not that far off. It doesn't get us the slightest bit out of the facility. There isn't anything optimal really. But this room won't have any light in it, so it couldn't hurt to see what's in it."

"Better than starving or being shot," mentioned Creed.

Three through walked about a hundred feet to a different crawlspace, this time close to the floor and not cramped. The three set out without a word, listening for conversations, alarms, anything that would tell them what the base was up to, but the only sounds were their hands and knees scuffing against the pipes and occassional blasts of warm air.

Then Electra stopped in front of a vent panel, and held a lighter up. A big floodlamp, came pouring out through the panel. Electra froze. 

"Are you, here for the show?" A man asked in English.

"Yes, we've got tickets." Creed hastened to response from inside the vent.

"That's odd. I would have expected if they gave you tickets you would have come through the front door," the man replied.

"The hell is going on?" Electra whispered to Creed.

"Give us a hand?" Creed asked.

"Clear away from the vent." he warned, after Electra crawled away, the butt of a gun sent the panel flying inward. Creed could hear sobs coming from behind him."

"We're going home child," Creed assured her, in Greek.

Electra, Creed, and Cora sprawled out of the vent. Electra flicked her lighter again, and they saw briefest glimpses of an old, white bearded man. He grabbed Electra's lighter and held it to an oiled torch that for the first time illuminated the room, which was full of transistors and large boxes with frayed wires creeping out of every crevice, perhaps the computer parts mentioned in Electra's hacks.

"They put computer junk in here now. Funny isn't it?"

"What is this place?" Electra asked.

"Fine question. Little known Eastern European installation built by the Soviets. Built on something much older."

The three followed the man, Creed talking the lead. "What is that, precisely sir?" Creed asked. 

"An ancient mine," the man stated.

"What kind of mine?" Creed asked.

"That was never really determined, or I guess no one really told me. Here, we've got a little motorized cart that takes us over to the Theatre." The old man lifted his torch over a rusty mine cart, and motioned the three inward. He fiddled with the cart a bit and it bellowed forward.

"The Soviets built laboratory over the facility. State of the art at the time, even a brand new mainframe programmed by the famous Alexandros Samaras," the man bragged.

"What?!" Electra exclaimed in surprise.

"Know him? Or just the name?" the man asked.

"That was my father. He worked with computers."

"My. My. Isn't this a surprise? I was certain I'd never actually meet you in the flesh," the man asked.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Your father was... very protective of you, Electra. I don't know if he let anyone in his room when you were there but I was playing chess over the system on the old computer terminal, and there was a player who beat me senseless. The user was in your father's room, and I figured..."

"My dad made dead certain I could play chess," there was defiance in Electra's voice but Creed didn't know who it was directed at.

"He said his grandfather challenged a grandmaster in Moscow, but I always wondered if that was a cover. Not that your father ever gave me reason to think he was lying to me. He was just so... restrained. He was the kind of guy who you could never tell what he was thinking," the man reminisced.

"Oh," Electra said. "Well dad didn't trust people. He wouldn't tell me why."

"Took his thoughts to the grave, did he? There's some people like that you know. God didn't make them to tell people their thoughts. Always easy to do business with those customers," the man didn't seemed to be referring to the Theatre.

"Business?" Electra asked.

"Oh, The Bank of Secrets."

"That a film title sir?" Creed wondered.

"Yes."

"We headed to the Theatre of Hades?" Creed posed again.

"The very one. You do have your tickets?" the may asked.

"Right in my pocket," Creed replied, checking his pocket, then noticing his tool belt and military pants were still on. "Hold it, got to take these soldier's pants back off again."

"Yeah, that's a right mind thing to do. They don't take too kindly to curious soldiers in the Theatre. Best to go into the Theatre wearing what you came in with," the man suggested.

The old man pressed the brake lever in front of a door made of rotten wooden planks. "He'll be going out the same way he came in," Creed marveled, "still in swimming trunks."
