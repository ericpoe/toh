"So, I see you found me." Ali grinned, "Tought i can't imagine how."

"You said you were going to Vegas."

"vegas is a big place... I see someone's traveling with you."

"The name's Margot," she replied, and curtsied, though she didn't have a dress.

"charming," Ali replied, "Is she current?"

"Current?" Margot asked, perplexed.

"Not on everything," Creed metioned..

"She knows nothing of the theatres?"

"No."

"Theatre? What Theatre?"

"Ali and I, we saw a film at a theatre. It wasn't..." Creed fumb led for a term. "Real."

"The film was fictional."

"No miss. You misunderstand the doctor. If we went to the same physical place we found it, it would not b e there."

"How did you find it?"

"We came into possession," Creed explained, of a ticket. The theatre can only be found by those with a ticket."

"What does this ticket look lie?"

"It's about the size of a business card. It says HADES on the front."

Margot's mouth hung open for a minute. She turned around, curled into herself and quickly placed her hand in her shirt, produing a card from her bra, and turned again towards her companions. 

"Yes," creed replied, "They look exactly like that."

"where id you get that miss? at the scene of something very unusual?"

Margot covered her face in her hands. "You could say that."

"Well it's not important wehere it came form," Ali rushed to comfort her, as he would any news source. "So much as which film it leads to."

"I'm not so sure I'd want to watch that film."

"Yeah, I get that. They are films form the land of the dead," Jonathon responded.

"What is dead should stay dead," Margot replied.

"It is perplexing," Ali added, "Of all the things to escape the land of the dead, why a story?"

"Why anything other than a story?" 

### Notes

A story lives. A person may die, but so long as their story is preserved in someone else's memory, they are in some way's very much alive. The details of the story may change, so to may it's significance. In this way the person's presence may be restored, revived, renewed, without them really dying. And as it is with
people, so too is it for tribes, nations, religions, and gods. 

So how does HADES live on? How does the spring of reality come back to life from the structures that choke it? Living stories. 

Question, how do I get this to come from dialogue?

### Ali's Backstory

I grew up in a conservative Muslim country in the Gulf. We did not have much, but somewhere along the way some of oil's sheikh's wealth trickled into my father's pocket. Enough to send me to a boarding school. 

What wonderful places of preparation for life, boarding schools. Excepting being sick or going to the bathroom, you are under some kind of surveillance. Most of that surveillance is your fellow students. You all know that no one is following the rules. Even the ones who manage to work their way into the arbitrary setting almost flawlessly--they're still not reporting what's going on. The snitch always gets the worst of it. 

So what happens is a sort of understanding. The boarding school is were I really learned "this for that". There was always something that you wanted, and always something someone else wanted. So you were conscripted in plots to procure things you didn't care too much for. I never much cared for alcohol in boarding school, I didn't care for the taste. Oh sure, a few of my schoolmates looked down on me for not drinking it, but I was always enthusiastic about getting it, because I could be in a position to ask for things later. 

I wanted books. Books they wouldn't let us read in the boarding school. It was not a common request. Usually it was pleasures of the flesh we wanted to indulge, but curosity can be just as compelling when it's indulgence is cut off as well. 

I read anything and everything. It didn't matter what is was or where it came from. Not everything was Arabic you see, and at the time it meant I couldn't read it. For that matter, neither could the students of staff. English and French mostly, though someone found me some Chinese once. 

A lot of the stuff was unsolicited. If you can get someone something, they get you things, this for that. Even as a child, I had a knack for getting someone absorbed in a conversation. I think it was because I did a great deal of careful listening, as if by instinct.

The school wasn't brimming with security staff. Rarely were there more than two or three people doing supervision. So if you could absorb one of them in conversation, especially around a shift change, someone who needed to slip out would have a much better chance. 

All the teachers had their tricks, or at least the ways I could get them to slip up. I can't claim to be a master at these sorts of things, but there was one teacher, in particular, who was rather vulnerable. He was a quiet man, devout, but not in a simpleton way. We were Sunni Muslims, you see, and I invented this "Shia friend" for which I would ask for advice about. Always with the implication, never really stated, that I needed his special confindence, that it was a sensitive matter. So he never failed to explain to me, quietly, why Shia doctrine was mistaken, whenever I would ask him a question about it. It was always under the guise of trying to "persuade a friend" back home. The friend was imaginary, during our breaks I would find the rare Shia place of worship and take notes for next year's round of questions. 

Oh, did we slip so many things past that poor instructor all year! Towards the end of the term came my reward. One couldn't quite sneak a contraband library into the school. But they didn't check your belongings on the way out the door, and my parents didn't check my belongings when I came back. My mother, was an avid reader. The way my family was, she could only read the Koran. But when she found me reading, she expected it was my school things, and never bothered to check their contents. And so I grew up, always on the hunt for the story, the forbidden story. What better training for a journalist?
