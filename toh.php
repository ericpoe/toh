		You are entering the land of the dead. Nothing escapes the land of the dead.
	</p>
	<p>
		Three Brothers, choose to split the rule of the world amongst them. Zeus the heavens, Poseidon the Sea, and Hades the Underworld. The sexual conquests of the first two are legendary (in its original meaning). One brother's sex life was not nearly
so fulfilling. Happened upon a beautiful young girl (Kore, daughter of Demeter by Zeus) picking flowers. A hole opened from
under the earth and he seized her.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kore did not yield to his advances. Meanwhile, Hades sought the blessings of Zeus, her father. But her mother, Demeter, who had already been desperately searching for her daughter, was outraged at this request. As a goddess of harvest, for three years she let nothing grow. The populace, starving, had no offering to the gods, and Hades relented. 	
	</p>
	<p>
		Or so it seemed. Those who eat the food of the underworld may not leave, and before leaving Kore ate four pomegrenate seeds.
Whether she was tricked, starving, or ate them willingly to put an end to the conflict varies by the telling. But, for her consumption she was bound to the world four months, in which Demeter mourns and litte grows, and the surface world for spring in which the earth is reborn. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, she has become Persephone, queen of the damned, as dread in her role under the earth as fruitful as she is below. She is the only being that regularly returns from the dead. Yet, from under the earth, Hades' domain, does all life flourish anew. The seeds of yesterday become the harvest of tomorrow. It too withers and dies, but not before casting out another seed. Thus is Hades complete acquistion (for he is the reprenstation of greed) negated. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Time too, follows this pattern. For in each moment of time lies the seed for a new moment in time when the old moment passes away. And as our reality in time, so too does this hold for reality itself. But from what seeds does new reality sprout? What lays the ground for the future? Imagination. The creation of new realities always needs stories to work its way slowly, sometimes painfully, from the soil of the present. The story has been told orally in public and private. There has been the single story teller, there have been troupes from the theatre. Language has escaped the confines of sound and become the written word. In the recent era, the story has become the film. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Theatre of Hades, in some form, is as old as the story. It has only recently acquired that name. It is where reality is
born, lives, suffers, and eventually dies. See, should you be so likely as to acquire a ticket, the birth of reality, and it's disintegration.
