This is where I write down the purposes of the tables I have in my toh database:

- init_calam

	Notes on the various calamities that make up the larger 12 prophets motif

- init_theatre

	Notes on the twelve theatres inside the Theatre of Hades

- trope_calam

	sheet on the trops of a calamity

Now, onto describing my idea of a true TOH database

Superparents: 

Texts, Tags, Datatypes.

1. **Datatypes** the various types of content / info
2. **Tags** (parent: datatypes) the little bits of info that will be called on any given text. 
these would include a type, text, and url (or like equivalent
3. **Text** (parent: datatypes) the raw text 
4 **Tags_In_Text** (parents: tags, text): a recording of where tags can be found in text
