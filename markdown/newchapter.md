"So," Dr. Creed inquired, turning the keys to the car, "We were supposed to talk scientific revolutions, were we not."

"This going to help your particular predicament?"

"It might. Then again, we'll need something to talk about in the car. [Greek Civil War][] **reread chapter on greek civil war, from a history / science point of view** The trip will take a few hours."

"Heh. I could lecture that long, when my vocal chords were a bit younger."

"Precisely. You were saying something about puncturing reality?"

"Yes, I was. To be honest I wasn't quite sure what I meant when I said it. I'm talking about something I think I've studied, discussed, and wrote about all my professional life. But a real explanation still eludes me. But when I just focus on the history I feel like it gets out, and sometimes... rarely, the math does it for me too. Only when I come across a particularly elegant solution."

"Math is all Greek to me."

"Yes. I'm glad you didn't get into comedy. In any case, I'm sure I've said this, but scientific revolutions don't happen that often. I don't know how many academic and pseudoacademic papers about how right now is a turning point, where our the nature of our understanding is about to change. Usually this is from people that just don't like the establishment and think science will subvert it. It often doesn't. But there are times when our understanding does flip on its head.

"I know the early 20th century history best. Einstein's always the easiest one to talk about of course. Relativity, it's assertion is simple. The speed of limit is constant for all observers. It's always the same because time changes based on your motion *relative* to the objects you're observing. Now for all science's adherence to empiricism, what everyday physical phenomenon would lead to that conclusion? And the assertions get even more proposterous. Relativity asserts gravity curves space. Have you ever experienced curved space? How could you even test this?

"Well, the sun, massive as it is should curve a lot of space. But you generally can't see light around the sun except for light emitted by the sun. But during a solar eclipse...  Well, they had to wait a few years. But sure enough they found light being bent. Einstein's calculations of how much the light should bend were wrong, but Newton's theory of gravity couldn't account for it. 

"Oh it was an exciting time to be a physicist. The discoveries that followed! That time was relative to motion. That one could not distinguish a difference between gravity and accelearation. That there was no difference between particles and waves. That space and time were part of the same thing. That one could not observe an object without changing it. So many things that were separate in everyday existence were one and the same in the world's fundament objects, if they can be called that. 

It was chaos and confusion. One upturning discovery after another, until it became clear, to physicists at least, that the universe's behavior couldn't be described in everyday terms. Only math and equations. It's fascinating. Of course that counts out just about everyone's ability to understand the universe, since everyone hates math." 

"So our everyday concepts of reality are just illusions that can be described with math."

"All my studies point to that conclusion." 

"Math incomprehensible to mere mortals."

"I've made a career out of it."

"So if it's all relative, and your everyday experience is just based on your persepctive, what do you do? Go crazy or keep on trucking?"

"I've never really been able to resolve that in my mind. Only to remark all this changes in knowledge come from unique test cases and exceptions. The current test cases are being produced by accelerating particles in mile long tubes until they hit near the speed of light and smash into other particles. That you might come across a test case in your own life..."

"Like my ancient Greek documents? Or your Arab scientist? Or for that matter just about anything that's ever happened in history? I know my known to survive Greek texts. The more I read, the less I'm certain about anything that actually happened in that period."

"Such is the case with memory. I've been losing it for decades. I don't remember how much of it I've lost, but I don't remember forgetting things as often as I do know."

"And you say my comedy is bad."

"Touche my nephew. Is there anything we should be looking to meet in St. Louis."

"Ooze, or at least something viscuous." 

"Well, that was random."

**Has Dr. Creed told his uncle about the Theatre"**

"You know, you can't ignore something viscous. It sticks to everything and it won't go away. Like peanut butter stuck to your mouth."

"Well, Jonny Boy. I can't say this trip hasn't been interesting. So something viscous. How viscous? Like Tar Sands Oil?"

"I think most of that's up in Canada."

"Nosense. In a few years..."

"It's further west."

"Blood?"

"I certainly hope not."

"Honey?" 

"That would be delicious."

"Mercury?"

"Probably want to avoid the toxic metals."

"Well I'm out of ideas."

"Ink? That's my guess." 

"Your scientific opinion? On what evidence?"

"Last film I saw in the Theatre of Hades was about a [Confetti Factory][]. Lots of strange ink in that film." 

"But your HADES is so unpredictable. Surely there must be something else." 

"Last time I saw the film in an abandoned factory. I think I'm looking for a dead place. Something discarded, left to the dustbin of history, on the verge of collapse." 

"I think that should point to the honey."

"Oh really?"

"The bees are disappearing."

"Good a lead as any I suppose."
