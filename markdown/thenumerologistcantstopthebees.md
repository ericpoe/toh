**Notes**

Just wanted to make a note on the story, based on new ideas I've had.

* I want the story to be a little more sinister. Previous versions have portrayed the actors as fools. But a story resulting in the death of every character is a tragedy. Or perhaps I should write it has a tragicomedy.
* The Numerologist is representative of society's continued reliance on numbers, especially in profits and derivatives. Maximizing crop yields and efficiency. The tragedy element should be the feeling of the other characters that they have to yield to the ideas of the numerlogist because the company demands it. 
* The humor should come from the ridiculousness of the sitation. Particularly the constant arrival of bees that shouldn't get there.
* Remember some lines: **Scientists are too conservative, unable to see true patterns**
* Also, **Can you imagine knowing your profit at any given second, in advance?** This would involve describing the nonlinear equations of business.
* More lines: **"Are we going to have a meeting in a dungeon?" Numerlogist: "I'm afraid not, mathematically interesting as it might be.**  
* We're all powerless before innovation
* Doesn't it seem weird that the best way to do things is through a consultant no one can understand? I mean the proposal may be correct, but you'd just like to know why?
* What happens when it fails. Who do we consult when the consultant needs consulting?

Ok, I'm looking to create my own computer projects and work on the ideas in my novel.

So: I remember the original idea behind the Numerologist Can't Stop the Bees. Corp. execs travel to a castle to consult with Numerologist, who keeps blathering about Numbers and Math until the bees go through the room. Cool concept, but I want characters. 

I want the numerlogist to be both an obsession with math and profits with an oblviousness to the world around him. The exec's should have a nagging sense of something being wrong. 

I wanted the numerologist to come later, and there to be a question as to how human he actually is. 

"Have you actually read this?" Keith Parkinson Jr. accosted his father, then through his copy of a 200 page treatise onto a stray table, where it resided momentarily before falling on the floor.

"I didn't read the whole thing. Enough to get down the vocabulary."

"The vocabulary? It's a hundred and fifty pages of math."

"Yes, combined with a difficult fifty pages of English, if you bothered to check."

"You said this was important business. *Stastisical Variation of Spirals in Improved Bees, and its Implication for Further Genetic Improvement*. How could that be important business?"

"The world runs on numbers Junior."

"And what kind of hotel is this anyway. Brick walls? No phone, no internet, no cable."

"Peace and quiet. I'm hoping I'll get some at some point on this trip. Listen, Junior."

"Don't call me Junior."

"Son." Keith the elder pronounced slowly, hoping to reach a more responsible part of his child's brain. "Compose yourself. Listen. Learn."

"Ok then," the younger at least considered being patient, not complaining about the stiff bed when he rolled into it. "It seems quite impractical for a modern company such as yours to be doing business in a castle, in the middle of nowhere Europe. Why isn't this going on in a skyscraper in New York?

"I don't really know. Some need for secrecy, some genius' idea of taste, some genius tax dodging scheme, I don't know. The point is we're going to see someone who can make the company an awful lot of money. I don't know how, but I do know this..."

"An executive is expendable. If the CEO can't make enough profit the shareholders will find a new one, nad that goes straight down the ladder. I've heard the speech before."

"Right. It's important to be important. But you have to seem even more important, and that means caring about appearances. So..." 
The elder said to the son, read the book because there isn't an modernity that will give you something else to do. Flip the switch off when you go to bed."
"I'm surprised I don't have to blow out a lattern."

"Ha."

The castle loomed ominously in the background whilst Keith Parkinson Jr. and his father sat in relative silence along with their chaffeur. There was a certain unease about both the driver and the silence that compelled the son to ask the driver, "So what can you tell us about this castle?" 

"It's very old. Survived a number of battles. The ground in this country is flat you see, easy to march an army across it. But the poor old bastard has still survived the centuries. They say it's haunted, but I don't believe in tales. Though I'm glad everyone else does. Means I can keep my job."

"Haunted you say?" The younger asked. If there wasn't the internet, at least a geniune ghost story was at hand.

"I'm afraid there's not much to tell. An old king here was declared a heretic, and he harbored some heretics. The nature of the heresy is difficult to say, the church didn't bother to write it down. Only that there was a heretic, and the people were forbidden to speak of him. Of course I'm sure people grumbled in private, but nothing really got passed down. That is, at least not for a few decades, when a subseqeunt king was murdered by his own professional assassin. There are a great number of tales linking the two. But that's all the are, tales. A castle's about a thousand years and a lot of stories are come and gone, some beyond any hope of recall."

"You would excuse me," Parkinson the senior cut in, "but if you're from the area, you wouldn't happen to know why someone would set up any kind of office in such an area?" 

"Your company is well off, is it not?" the driver answered.

"Yes, but not because we acquire expensive real estate. Never mind, I'm sure there's some reason for it."

"Why wouldn't you?" Keith Jr. asked.

"Why what?"

"Have castles in your holdings. They're worth money."

"Well, yes, but they just set there. The don't generate income. And the aren't liquid. You can't sell them."

"Only what you can be and sell huh? Does the company have no imagination?"

"We're going to see a numerlogist in Europe. That's plenty imaginative."

"Ah! A bee!" 

"Don't panic," warned the driver. "Don't make any sudden moves. Just open up the window."

"How did it get in here?" the son asked, after watching the bee escape through an opened window.

"They have hives several miles from here. Sometimes the bees come down here."

"Don't bees stay closer to their hives?" Keith Sr. asked.

"They used to. But with the new hives... maybe the bees get lost."

"How often does it happen?"

"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. Just some days the bees go off course." 

"Well, good to know."
