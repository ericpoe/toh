Ok, I'm looking to create my own computer projects and work on the ideas in my novel.

So: I remember the original idea behind the Numerologist Can't Stop the Bees. Corp. execs travel to a castle to consult with Numerologist, who keeps blathering about Numbers and Math until the bees go through the room. Cool concept, but I want characters. 

I want the numerlogist to be both an obsession with math and profits with an oblviousness to the world around him. The exec's should have a nagging sense of something being wrong. 

I wanted the numerologist to come later, and there to be a question as to how human he actually is. 

"Have you actually read this?" Keith Parkinson Jr. accosted his father, then through his copy of a 200 page treatise onto a stray table, where it resided momentarily before falling on the floor.

"I didn't read the whole thing. Enough to get down the vocabulary."

"The vocabulary? It's a hundred and fifty pages of math."

"Yes, combined with a difficult fifty pages of English, if you bothered to check."

"You said this was important business. *Stastisical Variation of Spirals in Improved Bees, and its Implication for Further Genetic Improvement*. How could that be important business?"

"The world runs on numbers Junior."

"And what kind of hotel is this anyway. Brick walls? No phone, no internet, no cable."

"Peace and quiet. I'm hoping I'll get some at some point on this trip. Listen, Junior."

"Don't call me Junior."

"Son." Keith the elder pronounced slowly, hoping to reach a more responsible part of his child's brain. "Compose yourself. Listen. Learn."

"Ok then," the younger at least considered being patient, not complaining about the stiff bed when he rolled into it. "It seems quite impractical for a modern company such as yours to be doing business in a castle, in the middle of nowhere Europe. Why isn't this going on in a skyscraper in New York?"

"I don't really know. Some need for secrecy, some genius' idea of taste, some genius tax dodging scheme, I don't know. The point is we're going to see someone who can make the company an awful lot of money. I don't know how, but I do know this..."

"An executive is expendable. If the CEO can't make enough profit the shareholders will find a new one, nad that goes straight down the ladder. I've heard the speech before."

"Right. It's important to be important. But you have to seem even more important, and that means caring about appearances. So..." 
The elder said to the son, read the book because there isn't an modernity that will give you something else to do. Flip the switch off when you go to bed."

"I'm surprised I don't have to blow out a lattern."

"Ha."
