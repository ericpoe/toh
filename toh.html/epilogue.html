<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p><!--
= Chapter 21: Epilogue
Characters: Dr. Creed, Electra, Walter Creed, Cora
Tags: [Family][Legends][Religion]
Status: Annotated::Staging
Synopsis: We see Jonathon and Walter Creed talking mostly of the film they saw together and Jonathon's attempt to return to the world of academia. It is here finally his switch to teaching Greek in a religious context is revealed. It is not for the dogmatist, but the seeker of legend and mystery he hopes to teach. Walter talks briefly to Electra, happy in her choice and now pregnant. Then Creed takes his leave, offering to tell tales of adventure somewhere down the line.

"Jonny?" Walter Creed, asked him warmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me uncle," Creed replied.</p>

<p>"Welcome, I... I only cleaned up my office for one. Who'd you bring in tow?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"My..." Creed stumbled for words. Girlfriend? Lover? He and Electra hadn't discussed their situation with anyone else. "My family." Creed decided on.</p>

<p>"Very distant relations..." Walter replied, intrigued.</p>

<p>"My new family. This is Electra, and her daughter Cora."</p>

<p>"You elope or something?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Well, no... things just sort of happened. She's pregnant, uncle."</p>

<p>"And you're the father? My brother will be scandalized. I knew there was some decadence hiding under that dry academic exterior. Cora a child from a different father?" he asked Electra. </p>

<p>"Oh. Well yes." Electra responded, looking down. </p>

<p>"You were also unmarried at the time?" Walter pressed, with a sibling rivalry of bigger concern than propriety.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well..." </p>

<p>"You'll have to fill me in on the details sometime. Cora looks restless," Walter noted. "You want to play with my smart phone? I'm sure there's some games on it somewhere?"</p>

<p>Electra winced just a bit, and Cora snatched the phone with great eagerness. "She's never used one before. They're dangerous."</p>

<p>"Dangerous? No one's tracing the phone on this old codger. I'm too old to cause anyone any trouble." Walter insisted.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's all right. Go on, Cora, you're allowed," Electra stated.</p>

<p>To Creed's surprise she'd been waiting for her mother's permission to use the phone, even as impatient as she was to get it. He looked back at his uncle's puzzled look. "Electra works in IT. So she's wary of those sorts of things."</p>

<p>"I see." Walter could tell there was a story that he might not want to hear. "So what leads to the visit? Not that you can't just come and visit." </p>

<p>"We're wanting to settle down somewhere... quiet." stated Jonathon.</p>

<p>"In the past I would have suggested your bedroom, nephew." </p>

<p>Electra let out a brief laugh of light mirth. Then she gave Creed a kiss on the check. "He's a catch." </p>

<p>"Hmmm... somewhere quiet. You done adventuring?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I found my treasure." Creed replied, taking Electra's hand in his.</p>

<p>"You two look cute. Love always makes you look younger, for some reason or another. So, you can't go back to your previous university job, but I'm guess you're looking to teach Greek again?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"It's what I'm qualified to do. Only my abrupt departure might make things difficult. I thought someone with your reputation..." Creed trailed off.</p>

<p>"I might know of an opening? No, it's not my field. And besides, didn't you leave abruptly because you were a tad miserable?"</p>

<p>"A different university. Surely things would be different at another university," Creed insisted.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about that," said Walter.</p>

<p>"You have?" Creed asked.</p>

<p>"Since we watched that film. The Numerologist Can't Stop the Bees, remember?"</p>

<p>"I remember it, now that you mention it. That seems ages ago." </p>

<p>"So I've been looking into that field," Walter took a deep breath, "I think it's hogwash. People trying to explain things with numbers without having to resort to reality. But it does point to a sort of sexiness with numbers. Oh, they strike people as quite boring, but there is something in knowing 2 and 2 will always equal four, or a right triangle will always have the same proportions, no matter what culture you belong to or religion to which you believe in. I feel like numerologists are physicists that haven't found their place. Their evidence to examine."</p>

<p>"That film made quite an impression on you," Creed observed.</p>

<p>"Didn't it make an impression on you? Didn't you wonder why we saw that film in particular?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But you must remember I saw other films that made bigger impressions." Creed responded.</p>

<p>"I went back over your paper. The one you've been trying to publish that no one wants?" Walter mentioned.</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"You're trying to come up with a biography of a figure so old, it's hard to know if he was merely a legend, even in the ancient era where Greek texts do survive. Even just a letter, or a journal entry, if it could be traced to him, might undo any narrative you might build around him now, based on the evidence," Walter observed.</p>

<p>"I was trying to answer a question with evidence when there was no evidence," Creed explained. "A bit like trying to conduct science without experiments. It was a fascinating puzzle, but a dead end. I'm looking for a puzzle that has some value."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well then, if you want to teach, you'll have to find a puzzle for your students too," Walter noted. </p>

<p>"It's hard to know where to begin, after all I've seen. There has been an unusual suggestion, but teaching Greek along with it, I'm still a bit of a loss," Creed wasn't sure if he could give words to the idea.</p>

<p>"There are other important texts in Greek besides the classics," Walter noted</p>

<p>"The Bible? I hadn't thought of that." This was not true. After his brief vision of Mary he had been thinking of her story a great deal. But he lied reflexively, because he realized the error he made. He had spent so much time in his youth being thumped by the King James Bible he had forgotten the original texts were in Greek.</p>

<p>Definitely some important stuff in Greek. But... you're a skeptic, aren't you?" </p>

<p>"For my survival, of course. You can't teach the history of science without knowing how scientists think. But you teach science and you never run out of faith-oriented types that want to discuss what science can't answer. I consider that a distraction from my own area of expertise. But it might be a gig worth taking on."</p>

<p>"But I'm not Christian either," Creed protested.</p>

<p>"Would that be a requirement? I think not. My brother... he has had own form of Christianity. You needn't think it the only example. As a professor you'd be dealing with religion in a far different time, place, and position. And If you're looking at legend beyond the texts, Jesus is a solid bet. You know the Greek. What do you think?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"You know, I just dealt with this dilemma before..." he stated, though he wondered if this was just an expression of the dilemma he had always been facing.</p>

<p>"There's so much trailing off in your voice. Are you back in the present yet?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"It was a conundrum. I was given a choice. I could give my life to save an ancient text, or save myself and trust on a less detailed version that survived to the present day."</p>

<p>"Which did you pick?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm still here. So, teaching Biblical Greek. That's a change in direction."'</p>

<p>"Any more than going to Greece and bringing back a lady? You will, Electra, have to tell me how he seduced you?" Walter asked of Electra.</p>

<p>"Him, seduce me?" she responded in amusement. "What have you been telling your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Hmm... she's feisty." Walter responded.</p>

<p>"A girl can't always tell a guy has what counts. Jonathon does."</p>

<p>"Well, Jonny boy, you've won a lady's heart. And I'm sworn to secrecy regarding your marital status. You might think of hatching a plan should you tell your good and proper father. Maybe you should tell him she's your mail order bride?" Walter laughed.</p>

<p>"Uncle," Creed said in warning.</p>

<p>"Ok, even I'd have troubles keeping a straight face on that one. But if you're off to teach at a religious college you might want to appear more traditional." Walter suggested.</p>

<p>"Noted. I'll have a few more stories to tell, some day. And who knows? Maybe another adventure."</p>
