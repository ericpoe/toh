Synopsis: Creed at last comes face to face with the Goddess, who has been lightly observing and intervening in Creed's story. In particularly she discusses with him the death and rebirth of reality. After this discussion she offers Creed the secrets of this process (in exchange for his never being able to return) and near the end curiously transmutes into Mary, a different "Goddess" figure. The story ends when Creed rejects the ticket for his current life.

Dr. Creed shielded his eyes from the pouring rain, and felt his shoes sink into a thick molasses of mud. They were now splattered, and the mud was clinging to him, a slow drip down, a thick disgusting goo. The rain pelted it hard but still it stuck, like an ink consuming confetti, a genetically engineered honey out of control, a black delicacy stuck to a desert flour, the corpse of a jellyfish not yet congealed. </p>

<p>He continued to follow the path where that mysterious ooze grew thicker and thicker. The intelligence Ali gave him after his night with Electra suggested his destination to be a building somewhere in this new city. It was a building with a door that never opened, which still did not seem to attract attention from anyone. After being caught by a presumably Russian military he suspected himself a wanted criminal and shuddered at the idea of approaching the place directly or moving in the open except under cover of darkness or rain. </p>

<p>Keeping his head down so as to keep it more out of sight, he glimpsed something that startled him at first, but which seemed obvious in hindsight. He had crossed a sewer grate where the mud was coming up, not falling down, and determined that his path would now take him through the sewers. This prospect was revolting but the physical disgust he anticipated was offset by the comfort of being away from view. </p>

<p>Creed darted towards an alley to plan on how to enter the sewers unnoticed, only to lose his balance. As he stumbled across the sidewalk his feet managed to look for balance on top of an unseen sewer grating, which collapsed at the slightest pressure and sent him sprawling into the sewers. He looked apprehensively for a sign that he had been spotted, but the grating had apparently returned to its position and he had made no noise. The sewer contents must have sucked up any of the violence of his fall. This was clearly not human sewage. </p>

<p>As Creed got to his feet he saw lights reflecting all about a river of faded images, somehow shimmering pink. The images, which never seemed to light up for a few seconds, were full of religious images and symbolism. The popped in and out of existence with such variety and speed that he had really only been able to identify two religious traditions. Christianity, the religion which had come to him as a punisher in his childhood, and the pagan religion of the ancient Greeks, which had come to him in his studies, imagination, and adventures. </p>

<p>Both had cropped up in the films of Hades, never quite possessing the characteristics he remembered to have outside the Theatre. Christianity had been used on him as a weapon. It had been a sort of blunt object that his father had used to keep him away from his uncle, of whose temporal and secular success his father had been quite jealous. He had seen this weapon again in the character of Atticus Rex, the murderous preacher, but in the other Christian characters he had seen a streak of mysticism. And the scholarship he had always associated in the ancients had been quite the opposite in his vision of the incineration of Alexandria. </p>

<p>As Creed continued the physical properties of the muck did not maintain themselves, one footstep leading to a splatter of water, another to a sinking sludge, another to firm ground. He began seeing his own face at times, at different times of his life. They increased in frequency as he quickened him pace until at last that pace had increased beyond his ability to remember his surroundings. When he slackened a bit for breath it became clear the supposed sewer system was bearing no resemblance to something that would be used to drain water from the streets. </p>

<p>He shrugged and continued following the faces until he spotted a utility ladder on a spattered looking concrete wall. Upon closer inspection, however, it appeared as though the wall had been made of marble and the ladder, though man-made in shape, was a series of tightly wound vines. Eager to give this otherworldly drainage pipe a break he climbed out of the ground and discovered himself surrounded by a parabolic wall in which there was a curved door. A door it was likely no one would ever notice, as windowless concrete surrounded it a hundred feet high. </p>

<p>The rain was coming softer now, and this time it did wash off everything that had clung on or caked to him. He noticed too, that the unsightly sore on his left shoulder had gone as well. His pocket, emanated a soft glow that seemed to be coming from his original ticket. Was this at last the Theatre which he had been offered a seat so long ago in his old university? Among the things striking him as strange was the continued discovery of a new ticket in which he wondered if he were not a guest at a theatre with a film for someone else. Where on earth was this ticket leading him?</p>

<p>Staring at the featureless curved door a dread possibility occurred to him. These tickets were to places called Theatres of Hades. They were all small, ephemeral affairs. Shouldn't a Theatre of an underworld appear after death? Is that what lay behind this door? He thought for a moment of all his favorite Greek tragedies, filled with their tragic heroes. The most moving had all a single characteristic--the hero's demise was not inevitable. There had been choices away from that demise. But the hero, so determined by the weight of his choices and their consequences, had picked the end. </p>

<p>These momentary reservations, however, did little to sway him. He too had the weight of choices to follow, even if they drove him away from a life he felt tempted to settle into, a life with Electra. He turned the large knob on the door and wrenched it open. It felt rusted shut, and the crackling of small broken bones echoed in the new place. </p>

<p>The place reeked of pomegranate juice mixed with a virulent strain of vinegar. A robed figure was seated, wrapped in study. Its turned, Creed could not get a good look at what it was studying, but it did not seem that it could possibly be a human book. </p>

<p>"Dr. Creed," a voice hissed and bellowed. It echoed about the place, but with each reverberation it grew sweeter. He could see the figure wrenching, writhing, but twisting into a more human figure which, in the light, appeared female.</p>

<p>"I have a ticket," Creed declared.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do." The hissing had gone from the voice, yet it maintained that strange inflection of being harsh but shifting towards gentleness as time passed. It turned around and he could see something thick and viscous running over a skeletal form, and he could swear it was human skin. Whatever it was that lay ahead of him, it seemed to be trying to take a human form to speak to him. </p>

<p>Creed looked about in embarrassment. The walls were wending into a fabric of pomegranate trees from which a few small fruits dangled.</p>

<p>"Pomegranate?" The figure asked.</p>

<p>"If I understand properly eating pomegranate comes at a price," Creed retorted.</p>

<p>"A price?" The figure laughed, "Human language is so coarse at times. To compare eating pomegranate seeds to a concept involving money. But you use what words you have I suppose."</p>

<p>"Persephone!" Creed called out in wonderment.</p>

<p>The figure turned around, and he could know see a robed figure with a human face, though he suspected Persephone had not bothered to shed her dread aspect under her robe. </p>

<p>"Yes," she smiled. "Forgive my study's ghastly appearance, I am still in transition to returning to the land of the living."</p>

<p>"It's summer."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Persephone agreed, "it is an earthly summer. But surely a scholar in this age must have noticed that, quite far south, it is winter. That I drift back between the living and dead is not so simple as my famous story, when I predictably arrive at the same time, in spring."</p>

<p>"I suppose if I thought of the story literally that might have bothered me. But they have to set you in a time and place if there's going to be story," Creed responded.</p>

<p>"You're quite right. Very perceptive." A pleasant laugh filled the room, though Creed could see no source. "My ebb and return could never be adequately described by human language or the restrictions of a human narrative."</p>

<p>"So, you're set to make a return then. A big one?" Creed asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, very much so. There has been a great deal of death, and I am beginning to gather the seeds of it for my return," Persephone informed.</p>

<p>"What kind of death, exactly? Not biological death," Creed took a few paces backward.</p>

<p>"No. It is not death of living things. It is a death of which I believe you are quite familiar, though not on a mass scale."</p>

<p>"Your growth time, your childhood I mean, was a lonesome experience, a story bounded by a reality not of your making, Christianity. You remember that time in your life story, when that reality was severed--died? When new stories and traditions held their sway in your imagination? Sprouting from the seeds sown in your mind in the library?" </p>

<p>"I remember that well, yes," Creed replied.</p>

<p>"Nothing escapes from the land of the dead unchanged." Persephone told him.</p>

<p>"I've heard a different version of that quip," Creed replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, but there is birth to consider as well as light. Seeds are cast into the ground as bodies are, but they sprout roots and grow again. You have seen the seeds of new realities in the many films you have watched," Persephone explained.</p>

<p>"And I have my own new reality," Creed responded.</p>

<p>"Yes. Though I would call it 'living' not 'new'. To have a living reality is to be able to accept into your life that which you believe to be impossible, but which happens anyway. A lost scroll, a Theatre of HADES with satellites across the globe, an adventurous life for a tedious professor, and perhaps most impossible of all, the seduction of a beautiful woman by a man with so little natural aptitude for relations with the opposite sex." </p>

<p>Creed felt his ego sucker punched but found himself chuckling anyway. His own laughter surprised him a bit, gave him a feeling of reckless swagger he responded, "If I've so little aptitude, why I have I got the prize? How many number of failed pairings really matter when I've got the one I really wanted?"</p>

<p>"Certainly true." the Goddess added with mirth.</p>

<p>"And I made it to your..." Creed trailed off.</p>

<p>"My study. If you need a name for it, and quite early I might add, or I might not have bothered with explanations."</p>

<p>"But why me in the first place?" Creed asked. "Is there something you're planning to have me do?"</p>

<p>"Understand," answered Persephone. "The birth and death of reality are not things one can change. One can only hope to alter their course in whatever way seems best."</p>

<p>"Like you?" Creed asked.</p>

<p>"Continue." Persephone eyed Creed curiously.</p>

<p>"Captured in your youth by your uncle Hades, secreted away, your fate argued about by your mother, Demeter, and your father Zeus. A mother so enraged as to scourge the very earth she loved, and an uncle to persist in it this starvation for three years, as you yourself persisted. Those pomegranate seeds you ate in all the stories... I have never been able to resolve this to my satisfaction, were you really tricked into eating them, or did you eat them knowing the consequences?"</p>

<p>"I ate them of my own free will," the Goddess declared. "I knew what it would mean. It would mean that, whatever I should make of my life, it would be mine. My husband, whatever his character, would be my choice. Hades, is the truest expression of what you call greed. He takes away from others so he may possess things solely for himself, in the fortress named so aptly after him. But if he saw in me merely a pretty girl and an obedient wife he was mistaken, for my life I have always kept mine, no matter how tempestuous it always seems.</p>

<p>"I believe you have most certainly got me off topic, but I believe I can tie back in. You too have a life for your own for the taking, if you work out how." Persephone returned to the mainline discussion.</p>

<p>"There's still that something about the ticket and your decision to give it to me," Creed continued.</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, the "why", the motives of a being of life and death is beyond your human grasp. But you will I think be able to deduce that your heart and mind were ready for the tickets."</p>

<p>"I sure as hell haven't felt ready for all this," Creed responded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not for the direction your story has taken, but consider where you were. You were writing papers on ancient Greek history, specifically as ancient as the documentary evidence could show. You were obsessed with figures your colleagues insisted there were not enough documents to draw any conclusions about. In short you were trying to write history without proper documents--in complete contradiction to what you had been taught to do as a scholar. You were looking for knowledge outside scholarly boundaries. Then you received it, in the documents, yes, but beyond your wildest dreams with the ticket. There's still time to watch that film, but, of course, it would be impossible to come back to your old self if you watched it."</p>

<p>"Then of course I'll watch it," Creed objected.</p>

<p>"Hmm... I don't quite think you understand. That film is in one of the <strong>proper</strong> Theatre of HADES."</p>

<p>"In Hades?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and there is another complication. The ticket will be taken at the Theatre, and they'll be no one to give it to you," Persephone added cryptically.</p>

<p>"I already have it," Creed noted.</p>

<p>Persephone pointed at the wall, which upon inspection, was a one way mirror into a room with a younger Dr. Creed. One muttering about yet another day of blank student faces. </p>

<p>"I didn't choose to give you that ticket. You did. You were given a decision about what to do with your ticket. You were given the opportunity into a land beyond life, and a land behind the illusion of cause and effect that is created by time. You made the decision, I recall, to give the ticket to your past self... though time does not require this same decision."</p>

<p>Creed looked down at his ticket. He had the possibility for even great knowledge than his forgotten texts suggested. A reality even beyond the realms of his theatres and enigmas. A riddle that no one living had deciphered. </p>

<p>But Creed looked back to that day he had received his texts and tickets. Were the bounds of human knowledge what he really wanted? He thought back not to the films, but to the childhood image of his uncle, with whom he discussed new learning quite frequently. He thought not of academic publication but his surprising night with Electra. He thought, too, of that moment he saved Cora, which prompted a new excitement that he didn't really understand. Why, he thought to himself, should the bounds of humanity seem so intriguing, when he had the pleasures of being human right in front of himself?</p>

<p>"I should like to give myself the ticket." Creed announced.</p>

<p>"Walk through the mirror, and put it on the desk. You will be rather invisible, for humans cannot see their future selves. You will then notice the ticket on your desk after re-entering it from a break."</p>

<p>"How do I get back?" asked Creed.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose I'd leave a time hole open in my study for more than just moments? I'll leave a fissure to go back to your old life. Now if you don't mind, this form is tedious. If you wish to continue, I should like another one." Persephone requested.</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>The face and standing robed figure slid together in a sitting position, and something seemed to break off and become something separate all together. The form had not quite made its way into curves and angles the human eye is comfortable with, but it didn't matter. This form had been painted a thousand times by artists, hack and genius alike, as a Madonna.</p>

<p>"Mary?" Creed asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, and of course my famous son. My feminine aspect is much more restrained in this story, but I like it," Mary replied.</p>

<p>"A god chooses a young woman for his own," Creed marveled. </p>

<p>"For different ends and motives. Though birth, death, and rebirth are just as important. If there is something about this story which is unclear..." Persephone waited to see if explanation was necessary.</p>

<p>"No," Creed responded. "I'm a thinker. Maybe you should leave me a bit puzzled and curious."</p>

<p>"Ahh yes. The rebirth of reality lies in the imagination. I'm sure you shall see it in your life, if not the world's," Persephone responded.</p>

<p>"Then what of the world?" Creed asked. "When and how will reality die? What is the source of these seeds' new realities, and when will they sprout?"</p>

<p>"You still have that ticket, if you're curious," Persephone responded.</p>

<p>"No," Creed replied. "I'll walk through the mirror."</p>

<p>Mary's hand beckoned him outward. Creed stumbled for a moment. It became clear that, upon depositing the ticket, the Theatre of HADES would lose interest in him. This, and his mysterious return home, might be the last time he would feel the hand of the Goddess moving through his existence so directly and viscerally. He might, until his deathbed, have to be content with merely sensing hints and whispers as regarded to reality after this decision. A tear falling down his cheek, he left the Goddess' study for his own room in the past. He placed the tickets on the desk and walked back into the portal. Before he was through, however, he felt a jolt of panic and turned back to look at the ticket. Just as enigmatically as ever, the letters remained. HADES. </p>
