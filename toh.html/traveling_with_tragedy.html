<p>The word FINITE lingered on the screen, and the Theatre turned to blackness.</p>

<p>"Fragmentary truth. Truth that's good enough for the moment." Creed stated in wonderment.</p>

<p>"That's it?" Ali protested, in direct opposition to Creed's appreciation.</p>

<p>"Well it's great symbol, confetti. Like my students, just placing a bunch of symbols on a test paper so they can get through class without remembering a thing."</p>

<p>"Don't patronize me." Ali stared him down.</p>

<p>"Patronize? I liked it. There was always that suggestion in it that Shawn blew it with Jessica and didn't know it. But it was never stated."</p>

<p>"You know what I mean. Don't play dumb."</p>

<p>"What am I missing here?" Creed asked.</p>

<p>"You really don't know. How did you, of all people, end up with that ticket? What have you done that merits HADES attention? I've traveled to the ends of the earth. You're just some hack professor."</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute!" Creed protested. "I didn't ask to have all this happen!"</p>

<p>"Didn't fucking ask. It was just mysteriously given to you. People have died for these tickets."</p>

<p>"Well then I certainly hope to make the most of it by enjoying them."</p>

<p>"Fragmentary truth! How the hell's that supposed to help anyone? I came to America for answers. I might have learned more about reality dealing blackjack in Vegas then coming here. And why, might I had, do you think there was a blackjack table in that film."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it had something to do with social control. That was a big part of the film."</p>

<p>"Social control! What do I need a film to learn about social control? Bollocks! I'm off."</p>

<p>"You're welcome," Creed responded, when he was certain Ali was out of earshot. A red viscous mess. That seemed relevant to him. He stood in the dark for a while wondering what Ali thought he was supposed to get out of the film. </p>

<p>At last he decided it didn't matter. Ali had stormed out of his life with the same speed he entered it. Creed still had his ticket, and he was intending to see the show. Ali's explosion only seemed to underscore how important the tickets must be. </p>

<p>However, he reckoned as he climbed back into his car, he had no direction. The film hadn't shown him anything about what to do with these rising phantasms he was now experience. That was a big clincher. As that truth nestled in him he started to empathize with Ali's explosion a little more, though he hadn't really forgiven him for calling him a hack. He supposed he'd never need to. </p>

<p>He made the determination that he had to see his uncle, who taught at the University of Chicago. He had always thought of him as a sort of guide, though that characterization he knew was inaccurate. His father had always been both a pious and jealous man. His uncle was a historian of science well respected in his field. He was both quite secular and successful--a resented rival of his brother. Yes, he would have to see him, if only to clear the noise out of his head. His job could wait, he couldn't exactly teach without being in control of his mind. So he turned up the heat of his car felt a great relief to be on the road for once.</p>

<p>The whole row with his father and uncle would have to be reconsidered. His father had been a strictly religious man. Church every Sunday, Bible reading every night. He had emphasized hard work, sacrifice, and of course faith. He had not, like his trucker, felt the blessings of faith. He had been more like Ali, he didn't like the idea of having his thoughts bounded by certain ideas or books. Better put, he didn't like the feeling of being bounded, because he felt something a long time before he had words for it. </p>

<p>Then there was his uncle. He did not know him particularly well, because his father had done everything he could to keep him away. He always did this under the guise that his uncle was not a moral man and proved this when he slept with a student. Creed always suspected what really happened was far less straightforward, and had only become an unforgivable sin because his father wanted to hate his uncle.</p>

<p>In any case, they hadn't spoken much. They'd only seen each other at family gatherings when meetings could not be prevented. Forbidding Creed to speak to his uncle had the precisely opposite effect his father had intended, for he listened in rapt attention to everything he said and glorified him as an idol. Determined to follow in his footsteps, he eventually grew fond of secular academia and a religion tradition of a very different sort from Christianity.</p>

<p>As line after line rolled by, so too did the realization that this was a problem his uncle's advice might not be able to resolve. He was an academic too, and put great stock in gathering evidence of which Creed lacked. But the only thing to do was keep his view on the road. He decided to take the scenic route down Lake Michigan to keep something vast and beautiful in his view. </p>

<p>After some time, in the distance, he spotted a small ball of red. As he approached he realized at was a head of cherry red hair, attached to a girl in a tattered blue coat who couldn't have been older than in her early twenties. She could have been one of his students, she had her thumb stuck out but was on the other side of road, headed north in winter.</p>

<p>A little desperate for company, he crossed over the opposing lane of traffic onto the shoulder. Despite his obvious position of going in the wrong direction, she ran up to the car as fast as she could. She seemed to know hitchhikers couldn't be too choosy.</p>

<p>"Where you headed miss?"</p>

<p>"North Dakota."</p>

<p>"What's in North Dakota?" Creed asked, mostly in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oil boom towns."</p>

<p>"Oil boom towns?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, I read about them somewhere, and they seemed interesting, so I thought I might go."</p>

<p>"I'm off to Chicago."</p>

<p>"Mind if I tag along?"</p>

<p>"Umm, no. But how do expect to get to where you're going if you take the wrong direction?"</p>

<p>"You have any food?"</p>

<p>"I can get some."</p>

<p>"Is it warm in your car?"</p>

<p>"Heater on."</p>

<p>"Well then, I guess I'm going back to Chicago. I'll see if I can't go to Dakota in the spring."</p>

<p>"Fair enough."</p>

<p>"You a Greek professor?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"The books in your passenger seat that I don't want to sit on." </p>

<p>Creed started to clear the books in his car and a few fast food wrappers that he'd never bothered to get rid of. The girl put down a back pack in front of the seat and put a banjo in her lap.</p>

<p>"You a musician."</p>

<p>"Aspiring. A musical instrument's a great tool for a traveler. They don't pay artist's shit, but if you have an instrument they buy you beer and put you up for the night, even if you're underage."</p>

<p>"You taking a year off after high school before going off to college? They do that a lot in Europe."</p>

<p>"Huh. I'm not going to college. Four years of studying and a fifteen year debt to pay off? No. Guess you're starting your winter semester aren't you? Round this time of year I like to head north and hole up."</p>

<p>"Why north?"</p>

<p>"People in remote places have the best hospitality. They know you've got nowhere to go, and they're in for a painfully boring winter except a redhead with a banjo and a thick Kentucky accent's going to be your guess."</p>

<p>"But you don't have a Kentucky accent."</p>

<p>"I just try and sound like my grandmother." </p>

<p>"That works?"</p>

<p>"It's a schtick. But when you're in a foreign land, you've got to run with what's working. You travel?"</p>

<p>"I've tried to make it to the Greek islands, when I can. I think that's where I left my heart, a long time ago."</p>

<p>"That's so sad. Do you umm... have any recommended reading. I could stand to catch up on the classics. Especially the dramas."</p>

<p>"Well, there's Medea..."</p>

<p>"Read it when I broke up with my boyfriend."</p>

<p>"The Orestria?"</p>

<p>"Read it when my parents split up."</p>

<p>"Oedipus."</p>

<p>"Read when my brother failed out of college."</p>

<p>"You seem to read Greek tragedies at the worst possible time."</p>

<p>"At the most powerful possible time. Gives you words for your feelings, characters for your company, an outlet for your emotion. A good cry. They're tear jerkers."</p>

<p>"I guess that's one way of looking at it. I never could stand for the choruses. They make the works seem like cheesy musicals."</p>

<p>"Oh, but to see them performed! Drunk of your ass in Dionysian wine and wailing together with the audience over life's harshness? I've always wanted to go to one of those arty film festivals but I don't think they could really top the Greek Theatre."</p>

<p>"Say," Creed began, "What do you know about the Theatre of HADES?"</p>

<p>"Theatre of HADES? That part of the classical tradition? I could use a reading list. Anything but Plato. He's not your favorite is he?"</p>

<p>"You have a biff with the man?" </p>

<p>"I had to read the Republic. I'm a philosophers and I think philosophers should be kings. I don't know if I should be impressed by the arrogance or by the BS he wrote to justify it."</p>

<p>"I certainly haven't found all his dialogues convincing. What error do you see in it."</p>

<p>"You don't really have to go further than the cave metaphor. He sees as trapped in our senses, and draws as people chained by our necks, looking up at shadows, right?"</p>

<p>"Ok."</p>

<p>"Other people in the cave are moving the objects casting the shadows. This are supposed to be the true forms. But it never takes into account that we, the chained, are experiencing our lives under the influence of those casting the shadows. How can we know those controlling the shadows aren't just going to show us another shadow when our necks are unchained?"</p>

<p>"For someone who doesn't like Plato you seem to have thought about the Republic an awful lot."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, it was really just to spite Mrs. Emmanuel. We called her "the manual" because she was never any more exciting than an instruction manual. She was a real Guardian."</p>

<p>"Guardian?"</p>

<p>"That's the name I have for people that make their subject so uninteresting that you don't want to learn anything about it. They guard you from your knowledge. I'm sure I'd meet more than my share at college."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not that easy. You've never been a teacher. I'm more a guardian than I want to be. I'm just stuck."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"You know your Greek historians? Herodotus? Thucydides?"</p>

<p>"I've read of them."</p>

<p>"Revolutionary writers. They thought what really happened in life was worth writing down. I think we take that for granted, and shouldn't. Most histories before that were tribal. They only sought to record things from the tribes point of view... and an inflated one at that. They really started a conversation about what constitutes historical evidence."</p>

<p>"Tell me more."</p>

<p>"I'm just stuck. I've been working on this Athenian statesman Solon. The evidence surrounding him is limited. He's really a test to the limits of history, and I've been testing those limits, see? But since there are limits, I can't get published. It's too speculative. The journals won't publish it. I don't published, I get pegged as mediocre. That means introductory courses where I can't delve into the complexities. The Greek I teach is so basic to me, it's hard to make interesting. Being able to read the Classic in the original, now that is the reward. But I can't get there in a semester. I try quite hard not to be the guardian. But..." Creed sighed. "I guess I end up as one anyway."</p>

<p>The girl didn't speak for some time. "Unable to stop being what you hate," she finally said, "Wow, that's intense." </p>

<p>"Are you real?" Creed finally asked.</p>

<p>"Real? You think you've been talking to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Then you have a name?"</p>

<p>"Oh. Phoenix."</p>

<p>"Jonathon Creed. Dr. Jonathon Creed. And I'll get you your book list. It'll soothe me, I think."</p>
