Synopsis: Dr. Creed discovers ancient documents regarding the fall of an ancient Monolith whilst drinking to forget the indignities of scholarly mediocrity.
-->

<p>The door to Dr. Creed's office hovered a bit as he realized his belongings had been ransacked. Given that there were only three days before finals, he could only come to the conclusion that it was a student looking for a copy of an exam. Not that it would do the student any good, for Dr. Creed had long learned to make alternate versions of tests.</p>

<p>His initial response to this indignity was to pretend nothing happened. So many things might have been taken from him. Curriculum, professional notes, research materials, personal diary entries, it might all be missing. He didn't want to add this to his worry list. So he just opened up the drawer where he hid his liquor to see if that was missing and surprisingly it wasn't. It was a vintage Greek white wine he couldn't replace so he was glad to see it still there. He noticed too that his pomegranate juice that he used to wash down the wine still happened to be there.</p>

<p>This was a surprise. If an ill behaved student entered his office for a search then the alcohol should have been the first thing to go. Insult should have been added to injury and his juice should have turned up missing as well. “I came here to steal exams. Oh look, juice!” That should have been the response of an irresponsible freshman.</p>

<p>But apparently it wasn't, so he sat down at his desk and started sorting things out. Fortunately the semester was wrapping to a close. He just had a few classes to teach, then an exam to give, he did have time to sort things out. Some of his testing material had been pilfered, but it wasn't material he couldn't replace or reinvent. He picked up the collection of papers strewn about his office that he quickly recognized as for exams, and negotiated with a drawer from a stiff filing cabinet that needed to be replaced. As he pushed it shut it screeched in complaint.</p>

<p>He then went through the more important task of putting together his personal notes. There was a chance some stray thought a great deal of time ago might suddenly be revealed to his detriment. There was little he could do about that now. So he collected the array of cocktail napkins and stray scratch paper that collected his random thoughts and shoved them in a drawer in no particular order. A casual glance showed nothing important. But a deep creased, yellowing napkin contained a phrase he'd coined and forgotten about.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no technical solution to the problem of being human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He sighed, and pulled out his bottle of wine. He didn't have any glasses so the only thing he could do was chug. It seemed disrespectful, but then again, there was no one around to complain except the wine. He finished things off with what remained of his juice.</p>

<p>According to today's IT technical culture there was a solution to being human, and ancient Greece had nothing to do with the equation. It was supposedly irrelevant. Though much of his teaching focused on technical issues like the proper use of verbs, there was not a class that went by that he felt that he needed to justify his passion to those who considered it at best just a class and at worst a waste of time. It was something he expected to get used to after being a teacher for so long. He never did. The sudden bursts of activity and the lulls of boredom, crunch time, student excuses, classroom disruptions, reading poor handwriting in an alternate alphabet, these were things he'd grown accustomed to. His heart never gave up on the feeling that everyone should care about the classics and ancient Greek culture. It was the root of Western civilization, a crux of understanding why things are the way they are.  It was an unrealistic notion, that it would have been rational to give up. Instead he just drank.</p>

<p>This was a habit he learned well not to discuss. When he did, he was generally advised he was running away from his problems and not facing facts. These things were undoubtedly true, but giving up his conviction seemed heartless. If he needed to binge drink every so often to keep it, then that was what he was going to do.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed went out to look for some cups of some sort. Drinking straight from the bottle was ill advised. His wine would be quite difficult to replace. It was aged wine and made with care though not with every modern method. It had a bit of bitterness that was hard to replicate. It wasn't the kind of thing one could just order. Dr. Creed stopped at the staff water cooler. Paper cups would have to do. There was still the problem of figuring out just what had happened in his office. So he went, sat back down, and looked at what was lying on his desk. Under a cluster of littered papers, his recent mail, was undisturbed. A thick manila envelope lay waiting for his perusal. He knew what it was. He contemplated tearing it open with his teeth but instead reached to the drawer that contained his letter opener. To his chagrin he found that it was stolen. But this aggravation was minor. He just wanted to know if the envelope had a yea or nay.</p>

<p>He paused, wiped off his black rimmed glasses, and opened it with as few rips as he could muster. It was his manuscript, returned.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Creed:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your paper is clearly written but unacceptable for publication. It is generally considered there is not enough evidence in the historical record to support the kinds of conclusions drawn in the paper. Your conclusions may be valid, but they are too speculative to be publishable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great, he thought. Advancing in his career meant getting papers published. If he wanted to do something more than basic Greek in a small university in Minnesota, he had to make his mark in academia. Yet for some reason he persisted in taking up subjects that were rather unlikely to receive publication. He had a particular fondness for the Athenian statesman Solon. His presence was definitely in the historical record, but his was a figure so ancient there was little that could be said for certain. Wasn't it worth pushing the limits of the edge of history even if you were wrong? To not be so worried about being right that you couldn't use your imagination?</p>

<p>Apparently this wasn't the viewpoint of the publications he'd been sending his work to, and experience told him he shouldn't keep working on the kinds of things he knew would get rejected, but he thought they were the kinds of things that were important, and hoped each time some new editor or staff might change their minds.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed poured himself another drink. Nobody changed their minds. The students thinking his class was a waste of time never changed that opinion. No matter what the assignment, there was the question was how little work they could get away with. The students of promise were going to be interested in the subject anyway. Nothing changed.</p>

<p>Underneath the Manila envelope lay another envelope he also recognized. This was a proposal to come on a show for an educational program regarding the subject of Atlantis. His sister had dated a producer at some point and had previously needed him to portray the “scholarly” point of view. He had become a regular for this type of program.</p>

<p>His old arguments against the existence of Atlantis would be rehashed. Regardless of the fact that plate tectonics demonstrated its existence was impossible, its continuation as a historical fantasy irked him because there weren't enough historical documents to justify believing it existed in the first place. The concept of Atlantis started in a literary dialogue of Plato, who had a spotty record for historical accuracy. Plato's prime concern was always being philosophically correct not a factual rendition of history.</p>

<p>But for someone reason people had to believe in this mythical place with advanced technology and a Utopian future that for some reason just perished in an earthquake before they could bring peace, love, and happiness to everyone. He got a play the role of buzz kill of the followers of Madame Blovatsky, Edgar Cayce, and a string of self proclaimed mystics that used the mystery of Atlantis to dupe people into believing they had special powers.</p>

<p>The experience was overall humiliating. He was a scholar. This kind of debate was beneath him. But embarrassingly the check he would receive would be about a fifth of his salary, which he generally used to see the real Greece—if it didn't have to go to bills as it had the last three times.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed put the paper aside black leather folder to his right. He looked to his next piece of mail. It was just a business card that read HADES. He tossed it up to an upper shelf and then first noticed a piece of parchment. As soon as he placed it on his desk he immediately took his hands off it. It was fragile, and had an unusual smell that reminded him of a library basement. He looked down on the scroll and read. The Greek was archaic. If he hadn't done some of the research he'd completed, he couldn't tell if he'd been able to read it. This was a noted contrast to classical Athenian Greek that he could read like English.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fall of Atlantis as Related to Solon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Creed took off his glasses and rubbed them with a Kleenex. He put them back on and reread the title.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fall of Atlantis as Related to Solon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He took out a magnifying glass and examined the parchment further. He was not an expert of the physical properties of ancient parchment, but the ridges, small tears, and uneven texture contained too much variety and subtlety to appear to be a forgery. He could not tell the parchment's age. But the text provided suggested the seventh century B.C.E., the age of Solon. If this were true it was exactly the kind of thing he was looking for. Why would someone ransack his office and leave this riddle?</p>

<p>Plato's tale of Atlantis, as told in his dialogues, claimed to be passed down from Solon the legendary Athenian statesman. Dr. Creed had never bought the idea that Plato's tale was true. He'd gone on cable TV to say so.</p>

<p>It was possible Plato had gotten the idea to repeat this tale, and tie it to the statesman Solon, based off a text such as this. Possible, but unlikely. As the text continued, it became clear the story was quite different from the one Plato told. It mentioned a massive island of an advanced pre-historic civilization that fell in a single night. The gist. But the narrative and the purpose of the text was completely different. It was novel. It was the kind of thing that could launch a true career in the classics if it was not a forgery. Eager to share the text with colleague he began a rough translation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These truths were passed down the Aegean Line from heir to heir to the great statesman Solon. For reasons I can only guess, he refused to believe the story and made the telling and recording of the story a crime. I write it down on this parchment until such time as it is safe to reveal.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Atlantis was one of far superior knowledge to that held in Athens. It was a nation not constricted to land. Via various construction methods the Atlanteans had constructed an island nation, a floating vessel country free to sail the seas as it choose. It could trade with an coastal nation, or launch a pillage whenever it pleased. In its early days, Atlanteans took it as a matter of course to acquire the iron and lumber to grow the city year after year.</p>

<p>Thus, the island began to consume more and more of Poseidon's domain. The industrious Atlanteans never stopped in the expansion of their nation. Lest all of the ocean be swallowed, Poseidon hatched a plan. He promised Apollo a sea nymph of beauty beyond compare if he offered the Atlanteans a prophecy. Having conquered the seas, the people of Atlantis were promised they could conquer the sky.</p>

<p>This prophecy was contested and jeered at by many. But a prophecy from Apollo was not something to be ignored, and some builders that had dedicated themselves to expanding horizontally began plans to construct vertically. At first it was a novelty. But as Atlantean buildings grew taller the people could see further beyond the horizon. With this new sight, the world was theirs for the taking. For each new thing one could see became a new thing that could be owned.</p>

<p>Vertical construction took off, and all the innovation that attracted the country's greatest minds was in vertical methods. A few without the imagination of the new age continued their horizontal construction. They did not heed the rumors that Atlantis may one day touch the stars. But they did. For a time the Atlanteans could pluck stars from the sky and arrange them as they pleased. They did not give that sky much order, but is not surprising that sailors today have a star which always helps them point north.</p>

<p>The island of Atlantis began casting a shadow wherever it made port. Upon this frightening marvel they secured great terms of trade and the country became quite rich. This wealth was used to continue in the nation's intoxication of height—a thrill known today only by a hermit living in a mountain cave. As Poseidon had schemed, Atlantis was quite tall indeed.</p>

<p>After the Atlantean nation passed over a sea of great depth, Poseidon sent a mighty wave to the great nation of Atlantis. It possessed such height in proportion to its base the island toppled in a single blow. Fifty foot waves followed in its wake. The People of Atlantis extolled Apollo for aid, but Apollo, god of the sun, retreated, leaving nothing for Atlantis but the sight of the stars as it plunged to the sea. Nothing survived sparing the divine aid Poseidon offered.</p>

<p>Twelve humans were spared on the condition that both they and their progeny send forth a warning to all nations regarding the fall of Atlantis. Without exception these were foreign born traders, instructed to tell the tale in their native language to their native peoples. I am progeny of the twelve. I write this story in hopes that it shall be safe to pass the story on to other cities of Greece and the progeny of Solon. They must know the dangers of attempting to conquer the sky and the sea. The story of Atlantis must not be forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Creed looked up at the clock. It was three in the morning and he had a 7:30 class. He locked the door to his office and hoped to catch enough sleep to make it through the next day.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed's next class was quite different after reading his newly acquired piece of parchment. The teaching and memorizing of a dead language whose importance he'd struggled for his academic career to justify seemed to require re-evaluation. People didn't want the details of a language they were likely never to speak. They wanted Atlantis. He knew this. The disparity in time and money between his incomes and television engagements made it hard to ignore.  Dr. Creed forced the notion out of his mind until the end of his 11:30 class. Not one to stand on ceremony, he found an obscure corner of the library and simply fell asleep.</p>

<p>He awoke around 4, and headed towards his office. Without suffering from sleep deprivation he was able to process the disconnect he'd felt in his classes. Dr. Creed had always loved classical culture, something that required proficiency in Greek to fully appreciate. For the Western world, Greece was the first place where scholars had tried to define life and write it down. No longer content to share musings and let time erode collective memory, the Greeks wrote not merely for their own age but for everyone that could read Greek. And over a millennium later, during the Renaissance, the classics brought back inquiry and empiricism to an age no longer satisfied with faith and revealed truth.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed finally managed to make it to his office door. But paused before opening it, and simply stood there in the hallway. Thinking back to this classes. The classics fueled that revival, in every art and science, and they could do it again. But... Dr. Creed paused while musing over a long held prediction. At last an answered question popped out. Revive it from what? Ecological Disaster? Climate Change? The Second Depression? The Fall of Civilization? The classics seemed hopeless in the face of all that. These were problems not faced by the Greeks.</p>

<p>“Did you forget your keys?” a student asked when he stood in the hallway.</p>

<p>“No, I'm fine.” Dr. Creed said, checking his office door. It was unlocked. He was certain that he locked it, but it was something easily neglected. He went into his office. The interruption was obnoxious. He closed the door so he could think in private without being asked if something was wrong. Dr. Creed never understood why it was difficult to think in public. When the brain was trudging the murk of everyday life no one noticed. But leave that murk and not hide it, then suddenly something must be wrong.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed sat down and tried to collect his thoughts. He felt the classics to be an antidote to something, but the poison itself remained undefined. He couldn't come up with a word or phrase for it, though it was something he saw in his students every day. It was an indifference, an apathy, a... sludge, of some sort. Sometimes he felt he was trying to drag his students through a clogged drain pipe.</p>

<p>Dr. Creed reached in the corner where he thought he'd replaced the parchment. It was missing. The translation sat on top of his desk exactly where he'd left it. Dr. Creed pushed papers aside, opened desk drawers, and began again the task of rearranging his library. Nothing. He knew this wouldn't conjure up something that simply wasn't there, but he had difficulty letting it be gone.</p>

<p>He picked up a pile of papers and was ready to throw them in the air, but something was amiss. The weight felt wrong in his hand, and a subtle, brittle sound could be heard as he moved them towards the air. Amongst his papers there was something that was not paper, or at least not modern paper. It was papyrus, and written in hieroglyphs. It was greatly weathered. Dr. Creed knew quite little about Egypt, except that knowledge of Egyptian was unnecessary to translate hieroglyphs. He scrounged a text from an old undergrad course and began to translate this new wonder.</p>

<p><strong>The False Scribe of the Sea Kingdom</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ancient pharaohs passed down the story of a scribe with a jar of nectar. It was give to Pharaoh to sample, and it was sweeter than anything known. He sent a great number of scholars to examine the substance, which the scribe called star wine. After the demonstration, and the examination, the scribe secreted the star wine away.</p>

<p>As the living son of Osiris Pharaoh demanded to know the scribe’s magic. He claimed to come from a kingdom far away in the sea, but that his kingdom had discovered this wisdom by approaching the heavens.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this Pharaoh ordered his builders to discuss plans for reaching the heavens. He asked the scribe if he had the magic to reach the heavens and the scribe said no, but only told the pharaoh how the structure should not be built. He told pharaoh that his kingdom, upon reaching the heavens, had sunk into the sea by making his building too tall. He suggested a structure with a wide base, so as to keep it from falling. The pyramid was the most obvious solution to the problem.</p>

<p>Then, having set about to build this pyramid, Pharaoh wished to know what might lie in the heavens. The scribe answered the heavens were the domain of Ra, and his domain was a harem without measure in next life for any pharaoh that managed to reach it.</p>

<p>Stone was laid on stone for centuries under the scribe's instruction, and the large and numerous line that profited by the dreams of the Pharaohs. For the scribe, and his line, had set out to teach the Pharaohs the folly of such a construction. He instructed each new Pharaoh that the last had failed, and the new Pharaoh constructed a new pyramid. Thus did great buildings tower in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Until at last a Pharaoh came who would challenge the story of the scribe. The seventh son of the previous incarnation of Osiris, he had watched all his brothers die of a young age before ascending the throne, lived well into adulthood thinking the position of Pharaoh would never be his. In this condition, he had questioned greatly the profits of this world. </p>

<p>He had heard the story many times, and had not truly believed it. Upon gaining the throne he became fully aware of the costs of construction and the costs of maintaining a court so full of descendants of the first scribe. </p>

<p>He sought to judge the value of such expenses. "Bring me the star wine that is so often spoken of in the tales. I must drink it myself," he declared, only to discover the star wine had long since run dry. He called forth his most prestigious scribe to explain the tale from start to finish.</p>

<p>Upon hearing it in full, he proclaimed, "Insolent wretch! You promise a harem beyond measure, fertility beyond imagination. But all I see is sterile stones arranged in piles, and a race of scribes that has greatly profited from advising the pile constructors. I declare the story of your ancestors is not wisdom but folly, and therefore cast your tribe forever from the land of Egypt, and forever shall I warn against constructing stairways to the stars."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Creed stopped his translation. He'd lost track of time and felt a throbbing headache at the base of his skull, near the top of his spine. Each word had been wrestled out with tedious search. He knew this document, should it not be a forgery, would probably undo just as much of what was known about Egypt as the previous parchment would have been for Greece.</p>

<p>The tale was intriguing. The scribe was supposed to warn Egypt about the dangers of obsession with the heavens. He instead seemed to have instigated it. The land of ancient Egypt saw a proliferation of monolithic tombs. Pharaohs preparing themselves to be dead while still alive.         </p>

<p>Dr. Creed tried to look back down at the scroll again as a scholar. He remembered the old saying, “Man fears time. Time fears pyramids.” The largest structures ever built, to outlast one civilization after another. How could a society invest so much on something that served no purpose? He heard the scholarly arguments. There was religious belief in an afterlife where one's earthly possessions followed. You could take it with you. There was a need to project power. The bigger your pyramid, the more a pharaoh seemed in charge. There was the eating of surplus labor. The “need” for a massive project justified keeping a hierarchical society that used slave labor.</p>

<p>Now there was this scroll. Crudely interpreted, the pyramids were made to acquire sex and alcohol. Which seemed the more likely scenario? Dr. Creed looked at his alcohol drawer. His head still hurt though, so he left his office for the water cooler. He drank several times. He'd hoped it might soothe his headache. It didn't. Nor did it wake him up. He just wasn't thirsty anymore.</p>

<p>He looked down the two hallways that intersected at the water cooler. Both were lined with about 20 offices. He walked by them every day. There was no reason to suspect he was anywhere else but state college academia. But he still felt he'd wandered into a dream. He looked down both pathways and the coast seemed clear. He took a paper cup of water and threw it at his face. The liquid collided with his face to no effect, other than making it wet. A few bead of it splattered on the carpet, some sprinkled his collar. He didn't wake up.</p>

<p>He went back to his office. Given the lack of volume, he thought no one was around. On the way to his office however, he ran into a graduate student teaching assistant. He didn't look at her and pretended there wasn't any water on his face. She didn't say anything so he imagined she hadn't noticed.  After she'd walked about ten feet he turned around. If she had a third leg or bat wings this might be a dream after all. When he looked all he saw was the backside of a female college student. She didn't turn around to gaze back at him. He was definitely in the real world.</p>

<p>He opened the door to his office and the scroll had disappeared. Leaving behind only a translation, much like the parchment. Dr. Creed drew in a deep breath and clenched teeth. He let the air pass out slowly his teeth. What was the end of the tale? He rummaged around his office again, and again told himself he couldn't find something that wasn't there. Obviously the pharaohs stopped building pyramids. Obviously, the scribe's story had never made it into a document known to history. It was not hard to imagine the scribe's end. No matter how high the pharaohs built their pyramids, they never seemed to touch the sky. Some scribe in the lineage must have been discovered and cast out. Perhaps a pharaoh was slaughtered and a new one put in his place. That was the logical end. Though Dr. Creed wanted to see the scroll reach that end, and not snake into some other story. But, he figured, he'd never get the chance.</p>

<p>So he turned on his computer and typed his translations. Every so often he'd stop typing, hold up three fingers with his left hand and flick the light switch with his right. No matter how often he flipped the switch, he still saw three fingers. Then he'd look over at the translations. They contradicted everything the scholarly record had to say on the subject. At the same time, he had no reason to doubt the reality of the documents. They were written in the languages they should have been, in the physical form of writing they should have been, and without any anachronisms linguistically. The only reason to believe them wrong was other documents, written in those same languages on those same physical forms of writing. It was a quandary. Add to the quandary was that the documents, from to cultures far removed in space and time, seemed to tell the same story.</p>

<p>A story that would be believed by no one but him. Because they were told on documents he might never recover. The documents seemed to barge into his office with a will of their own and leave nothing behind. Except a business card. HADES.</p>
